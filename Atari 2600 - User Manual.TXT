Video Computer System(tm)

Owner's Manual

Model CX2600A




1. UNPACK GAME





When you remove your ATARI(R) Video Computer System(tm) from the box, you
should have:








•ATARI Video Computer System Console Unit

•Combat Game Program(tm) Packet(with Game Instruction Booklet)

•2 Joystick Controllers

•Paddle Controller (Set of 2)

•AC Power Supply

•TV/Game Switch Box (with twin-lead wires)



Your ATARI Video Computer System is engineered not to show a phosphor memory
of the playfield or score digits.  We suggest, however, to protect your 
television:







1. When playing the games, turn down the contrast of your television.





2. Turn the ATARI Video Computer System OFF when not in use.





2. INSTALL SWITCH BOX





Your TV/Game Switch Box attaches easily to your TV's VHF antenna screws.  Find
the picture that looks the most like the back of your TV set and follow those
instructions.  A flat screwdriver is required.





If your television has four screws only:





A. Disconnect the twin-lead wire from your television and attach it to the
   "Antenna" screw terminals on the TV/Game Switch Box.





B. Connect the twin-lead wire from the TV/Game Switch Box to the VHF antenna
   terminals on your television set.





In each of these two cases, you may need to buy an "impedance matching
transformer"(also called a "balun coil").  The transformer is necessary only
if you do NOT have a flat twin-lead antenna wire.  It is availabel at a 
nominal cost from your local TV and hifi stores.





If your television has a "U" shaped slider or slide switch:





A. Move the "U" shaped slider to make connection between the two screws.





                               OR






Push the slide switch to the side marked "300 ohm" or "300 U".





B. If you have a round antenna cable:







•Disconnect the cable from your television.

•Screw the cable intot he impedance-matching transformer.

•Attach the impedance-matching transformer to the "Antenna" screw 
     terminals on the TV/Game Switch box.

                               OR


If you have a flat twin-lead antenna wire:

•Disconnect it from the television and attach it to the "Antenna" screw
     terminals on the TV/Game Switch Box.



C. Connect the short twin-lead wire from the TV/Game Switch Box to the VHF
   antenna terminals on your television set.







If your television has a short round cable:





A. If you have a round antenna cable,







•Disconnect the cable from your television.

•Screw the cable into the impedance-matching transformer.

•Attach the impedance-matching transformer to the "Antenna" screw
     terminals on the TV/Game Switch Box.

                               OR


   If you have a flat twin-lead antenna wire:

•Disconnect it from the television and attach it to the "Antenna" screw
     terminals on the TV/Game Switch Box.



B. Attach the television's short loose-hanging cable to the connector next
   to it on your television set.







C. Connect the twin-lead wire from the TV/Game Switch Box to the VHF antenna
   terminals on your television set.





If your television is connected to Cable TV:





A. Disconnect the cable from the back of your television set.  Note: Your Cable
   TV company may have already supplied you with an impedence-matching
   transformer.





B. Attach the twin leads from the impedance-matching transformer to the
   "Antenna" screw terminals on your TV/Game Switch Box.





C. Screw the cable into the impedance-matching transformer.





Plug the Game Cable from your ATARI Video Computer system into the TV/Game
Switch Box at the "Game" connector.





The TV/Game Switch Box may remain attached to your television antenna without
bothering your television program reception.





The TV/Game Switch Box can be attached permanently to the back of your
television set.







•Peel off the protective paper on the back of the TV/Game Switch Box.

•Press the exposed sticky surface onto any clear area on the back of your
  television near the antenna terminals.

By attaching a TV/Game Switch Box to each television in your home, you can
easily move your ATARI Video Computer System from room to room.  Extra
TV/Game Switch Boxes, part number CA010325, are available from ATARI, INC.
See Section 9 for ordering information.

Federal Communications Commission regulations require that you:

•Avoid using any more than twin-lead wires from the TV/Game Switch Box to
  your television than are supplied with the TV/Game Switch Box.

•Avoid connecting the twin-lead wire from the TV/Game Switch Box to any
  television antenna or cable TV outlet.

•Avoid attaching loose wires to your television antenna terminals when using
  your ATARI Video Computer System.



Any of the above may cause interference to nearby television sets and is
against Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations.







3. ASSEMBLE CONSOLE







•Attach the controllers by plugging them into the terminals on the back of
  the console.  The controller jacks are designed to fit only one way, so do
  not try to force them into the terminals.



NOTE: The COMBAT Game Program supplied with your ATARI Video Computer System
uses the Joystick Controllers.









•Insert the jack of the AC Power Supply into the back of your ATARI Video
  Computer System Console unit.

•Check to see that the POWER switch on the console is OFF.

•Plug the AC Power Supply into any convenient 120-volt electrical outlet.



NOTE: Using any AC Power Supply other than that designed for your ATARI
Video Computer System can damage the unit.







POWER REQUIREMENT: 9-volts DC, 500ma.







•On the TV/Game Switch Box that you have attached to your television set's
  antenna terminals, push the TV/Game switch to GAME.

•Turn on your television.

•Set the volume control of your television at minimum loudness.

•If your television has an automatic fine-tuning control, turn it OFF and
  manually fine-tune for the best picture.

  (Note: If your television will receive color only when the automatic 
  fine-tuning is on, keep the automatic fine-tuning on.)

•Set the channel selector of your television to channel 3.



The Video Computer System is factory-set to operate on Channel 3.  However,
if Channel 3 is broadcasting in your area, you may receive interference.  In
that case, change your television and Channel Switch to Channel 2.  The
Channel Switch is located on the back panel of the Console unit.







4. INSERT GAME PROGRAM







•Check to see that the POWER switch on the ATARI Video Computer Console unit
  is OFF.

IMPORTANT: To prolong the life of your ATARI Video Computer System and protect
the electronic components, the Console unit should be OFF when inserting or
removing an ATARI Game Program.

•Hold the ATARI Game Program so that the name on the end is towards you and
  read s right side up.

•Insert the ATARI Game Program CAREFULLY intot he slot in the center of the
  Console unit switch panel.  Be sure the Game Program is firmly seated, but
  do NOT TRY TO FORCE IT.

When removing the ATARI Game Program, pull it straight out of the Console.
Check to see that the POWER switch to the Console is OFF.



5. TO START PLAY

ATARI Game Program while the Console unit is turned ON, slide the POWER
switch to OFF and then back to ON.







To prolong the life of your ATARI Video Computer System and protect the
electronic components, the console unit should be OFF when inserting an ATARI
Game Program.







•Adjust the volume control of your television set to a comfortable level.
  The action game sounds will be coming from your television speaker.

•Generally the GAME SELECT switch is used to select the game or game variation
  of the ATARI Game Program you wish to play.  Refer to the GAME PROGRAM
  INSTRUCTION booklet for your particular ATARI Game Program for details.

•For most ATARI Game Programs, depressing the GAME RESET switch will begin
  game play.  Some ATARI Game Programs may use this switch differently.
  Refer to the GAME PROGRAM INSTRUCTION booklet for details.

•In most cases, the ELFT and RIGHT DIFFICULTY switches are used to handicap
  more skillful players.  Generally, Position A is more difficult than
  Position B.  Some ATARI Game Programs may use these two switches for other
  functions.  See the GAME PROGRAM INSTRUCTION booklet for details.



6. CHANGE TV BACK TO REGULAR PROGRAMMING









•Slide the POWER switch on the Console unit to OFF.

•On the TV/Game Switch Box attached to the back of your television set,
