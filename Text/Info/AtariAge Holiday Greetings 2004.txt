This is the game Qb altered to have a Christmas theme that was given away in a 2004 AtariAge contest or if you bought $50.00 or more from the AtariAge store in the 2004 holiday shopping season.

The game play is the same. You play as Santa and must shift colored blocks of ice so the pattern will match the picture on the right. If a snowman (monster) is on the block, press your button when you jump to remove him.
