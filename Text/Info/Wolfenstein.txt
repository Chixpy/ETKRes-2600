Wolfenstein VCS is a modified version of the game Venture. You are Sgt. Kozwoski of the Polish special forces. You have been helping a resistance movement that is fighting the German and Russian occupation of Poland. You have been captured by the Germans and taken to a castle called Wolfenstein, for interrogation, execution or, possibly, worse. Obviously, you must escape but, as a resistance member, you will want to hurt the German war machine, as well. Make your way out of castle Wolfenstein, doing as much as you can to damage the Nazi occupation as you can.
