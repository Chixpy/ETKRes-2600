Pac-Man Arcade in an alteration of the official Atari 2600 Atari release of Ms. Pac-Man. The music and graphics were altered to make the game look and act more like the arcade original.

The game is still the same. Move about the maze, eating all the dots and avoiding the ghosts. When a fruit appears in the maze, you can eat it for points. If you eat a power pellet, then the ghosts turn blue for a time and you can eat them for points.
