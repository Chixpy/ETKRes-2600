This is a cartridge that was given away by the AtariAge store as a promotion for the 2006 holiday shopping season. It contains the game Toyshop Trouble.

Toyshop elves Patrick, Quincy, and Robert painted all Santa's toys in record time and won a trip to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, they painted all the toys grey. It's now your job to clean up their mess, which means properly painting the toys in time for Santa's departure Christmas Eve.

As toys scroll by on the conveyor belts, you must paint them the correct color. Some will require two colors to be applied and some will need two colors applied in the correct order. Not to put unwanted pressure on you but you must meet a minimum toy quota before the whistle blows to end you shift. Good luck, Santa and the children are counting on you.
