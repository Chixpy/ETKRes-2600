 There are 254 screens which "wrap" together. ie: Going in either
 direction will eventually return you to start. Simply read the map from
 left to right and descend when you reach the end of a line [remember to
 read the new line left to right]. If you chose to go left when starting
 out simply reverse this, start at the bottom of the map and read from
 right to left and ascend when you reach the end of a line, then simply
 continue reading from the right to the left for each line. One is not
 limited to traveling in only one direction, as a matter of fact one can
 solve the game quicker by traveling in both directions.
 
 There are 4 different treasures types with eight of each to be found for
 a total of 32.
 
 Bag of Money $2000     I have a more detailed map [ie: that tells me 
 Silver Bar   $3000     exactly how many scorpions there are per tunnel]
 Gold Bar     $4000     but it would be impossible to reduce to ASCII
 Diamond Ring $5000     form without cluttering everything up and
                        creating mass confusion for all. 8-)
 
 This map is based on the ATARI 2600 version and I suspect it is valid
 across all gaming systems.

 Hell, stick a stamp on    Thomas Clancy
 an old cartridge and      1 Hunt's Lane
 send it to someone that   St. John's NF, Canada
 will use it - me! 8-)     A1B 2L2
