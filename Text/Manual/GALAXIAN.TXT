1. NOTES FROM THE COMMANDER

Welcome aboard the missile laser base. I'm Commander Champion, your
training instructor. These laser bases are used to protect our
Universe from alien attack. Each laser base carries missiles which
you'll launch from your control panel.

In your first training mission, you'll be battling an age-old threat,
the Galaxian fleet, which has thrived on war and terrorism for
centuries. Together, we must destroy these warmongers to maintain
peace and tranquility over the Universe.

Before we go into action, let's talk about Galaxian battle tactics.
The Galaxian fleet always flys in formation. As one ship descends
from the extreme right or extreme left it drops deadly bombs and then
returns to original position. The Galaxian leaders, Flagships, are
usually flanked by protective Escorts. The best way to get them is to
first destroy the Escorts, then go after the Flagship.

2. GAME PLAY

The object of the game is to destroy the Galaxian fleet before they
blast your laser base to stardust. The fleet lines up in ranking
order before plunging down to bombard your laser base. If a Galaxian
survives a bombing run, he returns to his original position.

You begin the game with three laser bases, and score points for each
Galaxian destroyed with your laser missiles. You earn extra points
for destroying a Galaxian in flight, and at 7000 points, you receive
a bonus laser base.

The Galaxian fleet attacks in waves. Each time you manage to destroy
an entire wave, another fiercer wave is launched.

3. USING THE CONTROLLER

Use your Joystick Controller with this ATARI Game Program cartridge.
Be sure the controller cable is firmly plugged into the LEFT
CONTROLLER jack at the back of your Video Computer System console.
Hold the controller with the red button to your upper left, toward
the television screen. (See your owner's manual for further details.)

Use your Joystick to slide your laser base right and left across the
bottom of the screen. Press the red fire button to launch laser
missiles at the Galaxian fleet.

4. CONSOLE CONTROLS

GAME SELECT SWITCH

Press GAME SELECT to choose the desired skill level (1 through 9).
The skill level number is the same as the wave number displayed in
the lower right corner of the screen.

SKILL LEVELS

The ATARI GALAXIAN game includes nine skill levels, each offering
varying degrees of challenge. Level 1 is relatively slow and easy,
and level 9 is fast and difficult. The higher the skill level, the
faster and harder the Galaxian fleet attacks.

GAME RESET SWITCH

Press GAME RESET to reset the program. Press the red controller
button to start the game; at the end of a game, press it to play the
same game again.

TV TYPE SWITCH

Set this switch to COLOR if you're playing on a color TV. Set it to
B/W to play the game on a black and white TV.

DIFFICULTY SWITCHES

The LEFT DIFFICULTY switch determines your laser base firing response
mode. Set the DIFFICULTY switch to B and hold the fire button down
for continuous firing. Set the DIFFICULTY switch to A and use your
thumb to tap the fire button each time you want to fire a missile.

5. SCORING

The point value of a Galaxian is determined by its rank and position
in the lineup. Drones, the lowest rank are green; Emissaries are
purple; Escorts are red; and Flagships, the highest rank are white.
you score double points for destroying a Galaxian in flight. Destroy
a Flagship in flight and you score even more bonus points. (See Figure
1 for rank and point values.)

Your score appears at the upper right side of the screen. The attack
wave is indicated by the number in the lower right corner of the
screen (see Figure 2).

The number of laser bases remaining is indicated by the laser bases
shown at the lower left corner of the screen (see Figure 2).

Figure One
DRONES
3 BOTTOM ROWS (GREEN) = 30 POINTS; IN FLIGHT = 60 POINTS
EMISSARIES
4TH ROW UP (PURPLE) = 40 POINTS; IN FLIGHT = 80 POINTS
ESCORTS
5TH ROW UP (RED) = 50 POINTS; IN FLIGHT = 100 POINTS
FLAGSHIPS
TOP ROW (WHITE) = 60 POINTS; IN FLIGHT = 120 POINTS
FLAGSHIP
IN FLIGHT WITH ONE RED ESCORT = 200 POINTS
FLAGSHIP
IN FLIGHT WITH TWO ESCORTS = 300 POINTS
BOTH ESCORTS FIRST THEN THE FLAGSHIP = 800 POINTS

6. HELPFUL HINTS

WARNING: Sometimes exploding particles from a destroyed red escort are
deadly.

Shoot escorts (red members of the Galaxian fleet) only when they are
escorting a Flagship; shoot the Flagship only in flight. Doing this
will help you score higher points.

Study the Galaxian attack patterns; that way you'll know what to
expect from each member of the Galaxian fleet.

If you need a rest while fighting waves 1 and 2 of the Galaxian
attacks, go to the extreme right or extreme left of the screen for a
few seconds. During the higher level waves, stay away from the
corners to avoid being trapped by a Galaxian.
