MESSAGE FROM INTERSTELLAR SPACE FORCE COMMAND
Space Cadet:
By the time you read this communique, we of the Interstellar Space Force 
Command will have been destroyed.  The evil Gorfian Empire has launched 
an all-out attack.  You are Earth's last hope!  Your assignment is to 
repel the invasion and launch a counterattack.  You will engage various 
hostile spacecraft as you journey toward a dramatic confrontation with 
the enemy Flag Ship!  You will be rewarded for your success with 
promotions in rank and praise from a grateful planet.  But you must act 
quickly, Space Cadet!  Brief yourself on the Gorfian Robot Armada and 
then attack before it's...TOO LATE!!
............................MESSAGE ENDED...................................

OBJECT OF THE GAME
The object of GORF is to accumulate points by destroying the various 
types of enemy spacecraft you will encounter as you attempt to complete a 
variety of space missions.

INTERSTELLER SPACE FIGHTERS
You begin each game with a fleet of five Fighters.  Only one Fighter may 
fire upon the enemy at a time.  The number at the bottom of your screen 
below the score indicates how many of your Fighters are left.

[PICTURE OF JOYSTICK]
Use your Joystick Controller to maneuver your Fighter back and forth 
along the screen.  Hold the Joystick with the red firing button to your 
upper left toward the screen.  To fire the laser, press down on the red 
firing button.  You have an unlimited supply of ammunition.

Note: Firing a shot causes a previously discharged bullet to disintegrate 
if it hasn't yet made contact.

You will be awarded one extra Fighter for every 10,000 points scored.

MISSION 1 - ASTRO BATTLES
Before taking off into space, you must first defend the Earth from the 
horde of advancing Gorfs and Droids.  These invaders descend in column 
formation and drop dangerous anti-matter bombs.  When the entire attack 
matrix is destroyed you will proceed on to your next mission.  If any of 
the invaders should reach the Earth's surface before you've destroyed 
them, this mission will be terminated and your Fighter will be sacrificed.

MISSION 2 - LASER ATTACK
This orbital zone is the Gorfian Empire's first line of defense against 
your counterattack.  You must destroy the anti-particle Laser Ship while 
avoiding its deadly beam.  The Laser Ship is protected by three Kamikaze 
Invaders and a Flying Gorf.  The Kamikaze Invaders will each continously 
try to ram into you as you attempt to blast them all.  If the Laser Ship 
is blown up before all the Kamikazes and the Gorf are destroyed, a new 
Laser Ship will take its place within four seconds.
	Points are scored for all enemies shot and destroyed.  No points 
are scored for Kamikaze Invaders blown up in a suicide-crash.  When all 
attack ships are destroyed, you will move on to your next battle.

MISSION 3 - SPACE WARP
You are getting closer to the enemy Flag Ship!  Sensing your presence, it 
generates an eerie space web which releases Gorfian Attackers firing 
subquark torpedoes.  Attackers are released one at a time and fly in a 
spiral pattern.  Each one is a different color and will continue to 
attack until destroyed by a blast of your laser.  A destroyed Attacker 
sends out an audible destress signal as it blows up.  When you succeed in 
destroying all five Attackers, you'll be ready for your next and most 
challenging mission.

MISSION 4 - FLAG SHIP
To destroy the Gorfian Ship and earn the right to work toward your next 
promotion, you must score a direct hit in the Flag Ship's internal power 
reactor vent.  In order to get a clear shot at this difficult target, you 
must also avoid the heat-seeking tracking missiles being launched in your 
direction.  Following a successful hit, a violent neutronium explosion 
will appear in dazzling color as the Flag Ship disintegrates.  You are 
now a Space Captain and will repeat the sequence of missions fighting 
against progressively faster and nastier robots of the Gorfian Empire!

END OF THE GAME
The game ends when all of your Interstellar Space Fighters have been 
destroyed by the robot warriors of the Gorfian Empire.

Note: THere are nine levels of mission sequences, each one more difficult 
than the last.  We wish you luck in getting to the toughest level; you'll 
need it.
