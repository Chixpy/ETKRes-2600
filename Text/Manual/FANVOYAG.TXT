FANTASTIC VOYAGE tm

TO SET UP:
Set up your video game system and left joystick controller as instructed 
in your manufacturer owner's manual.  Turn the power OFF and insert the 
Fantastic Voyage game cartridge.

[screen shot showing game.  See end of manual for my rendition of the 
characters in ASCII format.]

TO BEGIN
Turn the power ON.  Use the Game Select lever to select a play option.  
(The difficulty switches are not used in Fantastic Voyage.)  Press the 
Game Reset lever or the joystick button to leave the Demo Mode and 
compose yourself.  You are about to become very tiny.

THE OBJECTIVE:
You and your submarine are to be injected into the bloodstream of a 
critically ill patient.  Your mission is to blast your way through 
several phases of artery obstacles and destroy a life threatening Blood Clot.

THE CONTROLS
Once inside the patient's bloodstream, your sub will be carried along in 
a steady forward motion.  Tilt the joystick forward to increase your 
speed or backward to slow down or back up slightly.  Your sub is equipped 
with medical technology's finest laser ray.  Press the joystick button to 
activate it.  Hold the button down for continuous fire. You may pause the 
game at any time during the play by flipping the Color/B-W switch.

PLAY OPTIONS
There are six play options which can be selected at any time by pressing 
the Game Select lever.

{Page 2}

OPTION 1 = Normal Game
OPTION 2 = Extended Normal Game
OPTION 3 = Difficult Version For Advanced Players
OPTION 4 = Extended Difficult Version
OPTION 5 = Easy Game for Beginners
OPTION 6 = Extended Easy Game

In the extended option, the first five phases of your voyage are longer.  
In the dificult options, you will face more obstacles on your journey to 
the Blood Clot.  In the easy options, collisions cause less damage to the 
patient and there is no time penalty.  Each time you destroy a Blood 
Clot, you are given the chance to save another patient in that same play 
option.  

SCREEN DISPLAY/SCORING
While in the Demo Mode, the play option is shown at the top of the 
screen.  The score is displayed there while the game is in play.  A Time 
Clock is located in the bottom left corner of the screen.  A Heart 
Monitor is located in the bottom center and a Patients Saved tally is in 
the bottom right corner.

The Heart Monitor is a graphic display of the patients condition.  
Patients begin each game with a strong, steady heartbeat.  EACH TIME YOUR 
SUB CRASHES INTO ANY OBJECT, THE PATIENT LOSES STRENGTH. (The 
Phases/Obstacles section describes additional qualitites of each 
object.)  Every time the slower hand of the TIme Clock completes a cycle, 
the patient also loses strength.  A flat heart rate means that you have 
lost the patient and the game is over.
[screen shot showing game.  See end of manual for my rendition of the 
characters in ASCII format]

Points are awarded for shooting obstacles and bonus points are gained for 
completeing each phase.  The stornger the patient's heartbeat upon 
completion, the higher the bonus.  Be sure to record your high scores on 
the back of this booklet.

PHASES/OBSTACLES:
No matter which play option you choose, you will have to travel through 
several phases to reach your goal, the dreaded Blood Clot.  When 
operating on your first patient you must battle your way through phases 
1,2,5 and 6.  Phase 3 is added on to your second journey to the Blood 
Clot in that same play option.  From your third voyage on, you must 
navigate all six phases.
[screen shot]

ENZYMES: You should attempt to shoot any Enzyme you see in order to 
release its healing properties.  Blasting Enzymes is the only way you can 
restore lost strength to the patient.  Allowing one to pass you by has no 
adverse effects.  Enzymes are present in phases 1 through 5.

ANTIBODIES: These are released when your sub touches the artery wall.  
Destroy as many as possible for those allowed to pass by will steal 
strength from your patient.  Antibodies are present in phases 1 through 5.

PHASE 1: DEFENSE CELLS from the patient's primary immune system are 
released from the artery walls as you approach.  You may blast these with 
your laser for points, although the patient is not harmed if they pass by.

PHASE 2: The plentiful supply of BLOOD CELLS in phase 2 is beneficial to 
the patients health.  Try not to shoot or touch them as their destruction 
will have a negative effect on his condition.

PHASE 3: BACTERIA are an unhealthy addition to the patient's 
bloodstream.  Any allowed to remain there will decrease your patient's 
chance for survival.  You must shoot the deadly Bacteria three times to 
totally eliminate them.  A partially damaged Bacteria allowed to remain 
in the system will cause less damage to the patient than a whole Bacteria.

PHASE 4: Defense Cells, Blood Cells, and Bacteria are all present in this 
very challenging phase.

PHASE 5: As you near your goal, you will find that the artery begins to 
narrow.  You must try to navigate throught Phase 5 without touching the 
artery wall.

{page 4}

PHASE 6: Small CLOTLETS as well as your final target, the BLOOD CLOT, 
await you in phase 6.  You must steer carefully through the 
indestructable Clotlets to reach the Blood Clot.  Be careful! Running 
into the Clot is fatal to both you and the patient.  FIFTEEN laser blasts 
are required to destroy it.  All fifteen shots must be fired before the 
Heart Monitor goes flat.  Then, if your up to it, you can continue with 
the next patient.

HINTS FROM THE DESIGNER...
Avoid the walls.  Not only are the Antibodies dangerous, they also cut 
down the chance that an Enzyme will appear.

Get close to the Bacteria and the Blood Clot.  This allows your laser to 
shoot faster.  Try to hit each Bacterium at least once, but don't waste 
too much time on them.  Time is your biggest enemy.

Be ready for each new phase, since each requires a different strategy.

Watch the Heart Monitor.  If it begins to go flat, you'll want to speed 
ahead instead of shooting for more points.
