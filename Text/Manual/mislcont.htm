VIDEO GAME INSTRUCTIONS




<big><b>GAME SCENARIO</b></big>
You're in command at Missile Control.Your job, protect your Cities at all
costs. Waves of merciless Alien Spaceships are attacking. Blast their
incomming bombs out of the sky ..... not enough ..... Now get rid of
these relentless marauding Invaders ..... Blast their spaceships too. Not
easy once they throw up their protective Force Fields. Finally, there is only
one way ..... use your Defense Shields and try a bank shot off their
moving platforms.

The action gets faster and faster. You test every shooting skill you know,
plus invent a few new ones, but protect your Cities you will .....


<b><big>SETTING UP</b></big>
Always insert cartridge with console power off.

Securely connect left joystick. Hold joystick with &quot;Fire&quot; button on upper
left hand corner as shown.

When power to the game console is turned on, a portion of the game
display can be seen in action. The number 1 (one) will appear on the lower
part of the picture. This indicates that the game will start at level 1 (one).


<b>Game Select Switch</b>
Missile Control is a six part game. By depressing the game select switch
you can choose which part of the game will be played first. If you
hold the switch down, the selections will automatically cycle. The games
will update to the next higher number after all alien spaceships in that
section of the game are destroyed. The following list is a brief desription
of the various games.
<b>Game 1 </b>Slow bombs no force field
<b>Game 2 </b>Slow bombs penetrable gorce field
<b>Game 3 </b>Medium speed bombs penetrable force field
<b>Game 4 </b>Medium speed bombs impenetrable force field
<b>Game 5 </b>High speed bombs impenetrable force field
<b>Game 6 </b>Highest speed bombs impenetrable force field

Each game has a spacecraft design exclusive to that game.


<b>Left Difficulty Switch</b>
Each part of games 1 and 2 consists of eight alien spacecrafts. All other
games have sixteen aliens. If you position the left difficulty switch in the
&quot;B&quot; (or expert) position all games will have eight alien crafts.

(Note: the right difficulty switch is not used)


<b>TV Type Switch</b>
The switch can be used to stop the game (time out) at any time by placing
it in the B-W (black and white) position. To continue game play return the
switch to the color position. (The game will always play in color on a color
TV set)


<b><big>PLAYING</b></big>
To start the game press the button on the joystick (or the game start
switch on the console). To aim your spacegun (laser missile) fire, position
the movable cusor with your joystick and press the fire button. Your
projectile will always follow the path from the top of your spacegun platform,
through the cursor and then continue on a straight line to your target.

The exception is when you are attempting a missile &quot;bank&quot; or deflection
shot. Rising from the left and right hand position of the screen are friendly
(defense shields) missiles which can be used to deflect your projectile and
destroy an alien spacecraft. In games 4, 5 and 6 your projectile cannot
penetrate the alien force fields, so you must use your defense shield
missiles to deflect your projectile to destroy the enemy invaders.

During play the invading spacecraft will attempt to destroy your cities by
dropping bombs (alien missiles). Your job is to intercept and destroy these
bombs with your projectiles.

You can fire your projectile continuously by holding down the fire button.

In games 2 and 3 you can destroy the enemy by first blasting a hole in their
force field and then fire a projectile through the gap. Unfortunately the
enemy is highly advanced and have the capability of repairing their force
fields after a while.


<b><big>SCORING</b></big>
When the game starts you are given 800 points.
For every city the enemy destroys you lose 200 points.
For every alien spacecraft you destroy you are given 90 points.

Note: Should you enter the game at a high level and lose more cities (200
      points less) then destroy alien spacecraft (win 90 points) you may
      lose your initial 800 points. Should this happen, the game may end
      with cities still remaining.

At the end of every wave of alien spacecraft (8 in games 1 and 2, 16 in other
games with the left difficulty switch in the &quot;A&quot; (novice) position you are
given bonus points for every city remaining (there are six cities at the start
of the game). The point value for these remaining cities varies with the
game you are playing as follows:

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Game<th>Bonus points<br>for remaining cities<th>Maximum       
<tr><td align="center">1<td align="center">100<td align="center">600

<tr><td align="center">6<td align="center">2000<td align="center">12000
</table>
For every 4 alien spacecraft you destroy you are rewardes with a new city.
Total maximum scoring is as follows:

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Game<th>Spacecraft<th>Cities<th>Cumulative<br>(800 to start)
<tr><td align="center">1<td align="center">8 x 90 =  720<td align="center">600<td align="center">2120
