1. Connection of Video Game System: Connect your video game system to your<br>
television following the manufacturer's instructions. Please Note: Cosmic<br>
Commander is compatible with Atari(R) 2600(TM), Colecovision(TM) with<br>
Expansion Module for Atari(R), and Sears Tele-Games(R) Video Arcade(TM).<br>
<br>
2. Preparation of Cosmic Commander:<br>
<br>
A. BATTERY INSERTION: Four &quot;D&quot; size batteries are required to power the<br>
special effects (lights and vibrations) of Cosmic Commander. To insert<br>
batteries, carefully turn Cosmic Commander upside down. Open up the<br>
battery compartment door by gently lifting up the latch and sliding it<br>
over the stop. Then slide the door out from under the tabs as shown in<br>
Figure 1.<br>
<br>
Lift off the door and insert the four batteries into the compartment<br>

SURVIVAL RUN (TM) INSTRUCTIONS<br>
<br>
Powerful aliens have assembled an awesome strike force to destroy Earth. Grab<br>
the controls of your starfighter and attack the enemy fortress, lying deep<br>
inside a distant planet. Fly through the maze of subterranean caverns at hyp-<br>
erspeed, following your onboard computer map for navigation. Fire your photon <br>
torpedoes to zap enemy force fields and marauding alien guards as you race <br>
toward the ultimate showdown against the Alien Master in his command ship.<br>
<br>
<br>
OBJECT OF THE GAME<br>
<br>
Maneuver through the maze of tunnels, shooting alien guards, force fields,<br>
and the alien command ship to score the most points.<br>
<br>
<br>
HOW TO SET UP THE GAME<br>
<br>
1. Cartridge Insertion: make sure the Power Switch on your video game system<br>
is OFF. Hold the cartridge so the large Survival Run label on the top <br>
panel is towards you and reads right side up, then carefully insert the <br>
cartridge into the cartridge slot. Make sure the cartridge is fully<br>
inserted in the slot, but do not try to force it. Please Note: when rem-<br>
oving the cartridge, turn the Power Switch OFF, then carefully pull the<br>
cartridge straight out of the slot.<br>
<br>
2. Turn your TV on and slide the Power Switch ON. You'll hear a short series<br>
of musical notes. Adjust the volume control on your television set to the<br>
desired level. Also, the entrance to the first tunnel appears on your TV <br>
screen.<br>
<br>
3. Skill Levels: there are five different skill levels,numbered 1 through 5.<br>
When you slide the Power Switch on, the game is on skill level 1. This<br>
number is displayed at the top of the screen. Skill level 1 is the easiest<br>
because your starfighter is flying the slowest. Skill level 5 is the hard-<br>
est because your starfighter is flying the fastest. To change the skill <br>
level, depress the Game Select Switch. Each time you depress it, the skill<br>
level increases by 1 until it reaches 5, then it returns to 1. <br>
Please Note: the skill level cannot be changed during the game.<br>

<br>
HOW TO PLAY THE GAME<br>
<br>
1. Starting the Game: press the fire button on your Control to start the <br>
game.<br>
<br>
2. Your Energy Level: at the start of the game, the energy cells of your <br>
Starfighter are fully charged. Your energy level is displayed on the<br>
screen by the black dot on the green energy bar above your score. As you<br>
lose energy the dot moves across the bar to the left. If your energy falls<br>
to 50%, the bar will turn yellow to caution you. If your energy level <br>
falls to 25%, the bar will turn red to warn you. You lose energy when your<br>
Starfighter is hit by a force field or shot by an alien guard or the alien<br>
command ship. Also you lose energy each time you shoot your laser cannon<br>
or your gunsight touches a side wall in a tunnel. You gain energy each<br>
time you successfully complete a tunnel in a maze. If you successfully<br>
navigate the entire maze and destroy the alien command ship, your energy<br>
cells will be fully recharged.<br>
<br>
3. The Computer Map: the computer map at the top of the screen shows the<br>
interconnecting maze of underground tunnels within the alien planet.<br>
Refer to Figure 5 to see an example of a computer map. The blinking white<br>
dot is your position in the maze. You must travel from the left side of<br>
the maze to the right side. As you fly your starfighter through the <br>
tunnels, the dot moves to show your changing position in the maze. There<br>
is only one safe route through the maze so be very careful.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
When you approach the intersection at the end of each tunnel as shown in<br>
Figure 6, you must decide whether to take the tunnel to the right or the<br>
tunnel to the left. If you hit the divider between the two tunnels or if<br>
you make the wrong choice and fly into a dead end tunnel, you will crash.<br>
Use this computerized map as your guide as you navigate through the maze.<br>
Check it before you reach an intersection so you'll know which way to <br>
turn.<br>
<br>

TOP-<br>
CENTER, &quot;SCORE&quot; IS BOTTOM-CENTER AND THE &quot;ENERGY BAR&quot; IS JUST ABOVE
THE <br>
SCORE.]<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Flying Your Starfighter: the screen shows your view of the tunnels from<br>
the cockpit of your starfighter. You can sense your tremendous speed from<br>
the way the walls, ceiling and floor of the tunnel rush toward you. Your<br>
starfighter always flies through the center of a tunnel. The cross-shaped<br>
gunsight on the screen shows the direction in which your laser cannon is <br>
aimed. To move the sight to the left, turn your Control to the left. To<br>
move the sight to the right, turn your Control to the right. Pull your<br>
Control back to move the sight toward the floor of the tunnel. Push your<br>
Control forward to move the sight toward the ceiling of the tunnel. When<br>
you approach the intersection at the end of each tunnel, aim the sight in<br>
the direction that you want to fly. For example, if you check your comp-<br>
uter map and see that you must make a right turn at the next intersection,<br>
aim the sight toward the entrance to the tunnel on the right side of the<br>
divider when you approach the intersection.<br>
<br>
5. Shooting Alien Guards: your fire button is on top of the left handgrip of<br>
your Control. Press it to shoot photon torpedoes from your laser cannon.<br>
You can shoot single shot or rapid-fire. Each shot drains energy from <br>
your energy cells. Use the cross-shaped gunsight on the screen to aim<br>
your laser cannon. Alien guards appear at the far end of the tunnel and<br>
move toward you. Maneuver your gunsight so the alien guard is in the <br>
center of the sight, then fire. You'll see a photon torpedo shoot directly<br>
ahead of you into the center of the cross shape as shown in Figure 7.<br>
When you shoot an alien guard, he is instantly vaporized. Alien guards<br>
have short-range laser guns so be careful. If you let them get too close,<br>
they'll shoot at you. Each shot that hits the deflector shields of your<br>
starfighter drains energy from your energy cells.<br>
<br>

<br>
[SCREEN SHOT LOOKING DOWN TUNNEL. AN &quot;ALIEN GUARD&quot; IS NEAR THE RIGHT-HAND<br>
WALL. (LOOKS LIKE A FLYING SAUCER WITH EYES). YOUR &quot;GUNSIGHT&quot; IS BELOW <br>
THE GUARD AND A &quot;PHOTON TORPEDO&quot; IS SEEN HEADING STRAIGHT UP FROM THE <br>
BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN TOWARD THE GUNSIGHT.]<br>
<br>
<br>
6. Shooting Alien Force Fields: alien force fields appear at the far end of <br>
the tunnel and move toward you, emitting a loud sound. The only way to<br>
destroy a force field is to shoot its source which is the small box that<br>
floats near the wall on either the right side or the left side of the<br>
force field as shown in Figure 8. When you shoot the source, the force<br>
field is instantly vaporized. If the force field hits the deflector <br>
shields of your starfighter, it drains energy from your energy cells.<br>
<br>

OF THE TUNNEL. (LOOKS LIKE A PARTIALLY TRANSPARENT DIVIDER PER FIG. 6.)<br>

ABOVE AND TO THE RIGHT OF CENTER-SCREEN. (LOOKS LIKE A SIMPLE TYPE OF<br>
SPACE STATION.)]<br>
<br>
<br>
7. Shooting the Alien Command Ship: if you successfully navigate the entire<br>
maze, you will confront the Alien Master in his Command Ship as shown in<br>
Figure 9. You must shoot the command ship many times to destroy it. The<br>
command ship has a powerful laser gun so watch out. If it shoots you, it<br>
drains large amounts of energy from your energy cells.<br>
<br>
8. If you complete an entire maze and destroy the alien command ship, you'll<br>
be warped to the start of a new and tougher maze and your energy cells<br>
will be fully recharged.<br>
<br>
9. Scoring: your score is displayed at the bottom of the screen. Every <br>
target you destroy and each tunnel you successfully navigate adds to your <br>
score. The chart below shows points awarded for destroying targets on each<br>
skill level.<br>
