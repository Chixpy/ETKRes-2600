reeling from radiation poisoning. There's little hope for humanity's survival. It's up to
you to help the few remaining people.<br>

vaccine to the survivors. Your journey will not be an easy one, Nefarious henchmen are
waiting to knock you off and steal the vaccine to ensure that they will survive to rule
the planet. Every driver on the road is out to get you. Your only hope is to get them
first.<br>
<br>
You must find the rocket poised to launch a satellite that can nullify the effects of this
cosmic accident that turned the world upside down. If you're sharp enough to learn the
secret code words and tough enough to live to use them, you can launch the rocket and save
the world!<br>
<br>
Good luck! Humanity is in your hands.<br>

tires, and armor; the number of shots you have left; and the amount of fuel remaining in

<br>
As you move from city to city, you will encounter various obstacles. The black patches on
the screen are oil slicks, which can damage your tires. Yellow and white striped
roadblocks should be avoided at all costs; if you hit one of these, it can damage your car
severely. Roadside obstacles include houses, trees, and other hazards. Hitting obstacles

vehicles with machinegun fire.<br>

power surge, hold down the fire button and move the directional control forward. If you
fail to power surge the car in front, you may crash, damaging your vehicle.<br>

If an enemy car comes up behind you, you can destroy it by pulling back quickly on the
directional control to brake. To survive a side attack, you must smash into the vehicle
and destroy it. If the enemy car gets you first, you will receive damage.<br>
<br>
You can also receive 20 bonus points for permanently passing an enemy car. To do this, you
must stay ahead of him until he disappears off the bottom of the radar. If he comes up
from behind and passes you again, you receive no bonus points.<br>

Look for yellow diamonds alongside the road. You will see the diamonds after you destroy
enemy vehicles. Grab one of these to restore your car's engine and armor. In addition, you
can replace your fuel and ammunition by running over dots along the way. Green dots
replace bullets and blue dots replace fuel. If you still have fuel remaining when you run
over a blue dot, you will receive 20 bonus points. If you have run out of fuel, you
receive no bonus points.<br>

time to save any of its inhabitants, the survivors appear on the screen. You receive bonus
points for each person you save. You can use your bonus points to upgrade the condition of
your vehicle or purchase fuel.<br>
<br>
If you arrive too late to save the city, fewer survivors appear and you receive fewer
bonus points.<br>
<br>

<br>
A message from headquarters appears on your screen. Read the message, then press the fire
button. The Vehicle Upgrade screen appears. To upgrade your vehicle or purchase fuel, move
the controller up or down until your selection highlights. Then move your controller right
to purchase the highlighted item. After purchasing upgrades, highlight the word Go and
press the fire button.<br>
<br>
If you arrive safely at the rocket base, the rocket will launch the world-saving satellite
and you will win the game.<br>
<br>
<strong><big>Strategy</big></strong><br>
<br>
Learn which store items you need to purchase at the cities. If you are really good at
acquiring the off-road yellow diamonds, you may only need to purchase better tires and
fuel at most stops.<br>
<br>
Watch out for cars behind you! Quick braking will destroy them without damage to your car.<br>
<br>
Learn to power surge. Head-on collisions hurt more than just your car's expensive paint
job.<br>
<br>
Go off the right side of the road immediately after destroying an enemy vehicle and you
might get a valuable diamond.<br>
