HOW TO PLAY BLACK JACK
----------------------

This Game Program has two games of Black Jack:
* Game 1 -- One or two players with card splitting
* Game 2 -- Up to four players with no card splitting
All players compete against the Computer Dealer.  Each card is worth
points.  The object is to score 21 points or as close to 21 points as
possible without "busting" (exceeding 21 points).

Note the following point system for cards:
* Number Cards = Face Value (i.e. 5 = 5 points)
* Ace (A) = 1 or 11 points
* Jack (J), Queen (Q), and King (K) = 10 points


Hard and Soft Hands

A card hand is called soft when the Ace is used as 11 points.  A card
hand is hard when the Ace is used as 1 point.  For example, a soft 17
is an Ace (11 points) and a 6.  A hard 17 could be 10,6 and an Ace (1
point).


Hit or Stay

The Computer deals two cards face-up to each player.  The Computer also
deals two cards to itself -- one face-up and another face-down.  If you
are satisfied with the points of your first cards, STAY on that hand. 
If you want more points, request a HIT, and the dealer will give you
another card.  Continue to take hits until:
1 -- You are satisfied with your hand (STAY)
     OR
2 -- You exceed 21 points and BUST (lose the game).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Accepted Black Jack strategy is to STAY on 18, 19 or 20 points.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Winning

When you win a hand, you win the amount of chips you bet.  You win
whenever:

* Your card hand equals 21 points or less and is more points than the   
  dealer's hand.
* The dealer busts by exceeding 21 points.
* You score Black Jack (Ace and a face card or a 10-card).

When you score Black Jack, you win 1 1/2 times your bet.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: A tie game (called PUSH) occurs when the dealer's card points
equal your card points.  In a push you do not win or lose your bet.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTROLLER ACTION TO PLAY BLACK JACK

To Begin Play

Press your red controller button once to get into the game.  Press the
controller button again to place your bet.


Betting

Each player receives a "Bank" of 1000 chips.  When it's time to bet, a
question mark will appear to the right of your betting digits.  Turn
the controller knob to select the amount of your bet, which can range
from 20 to 200 chips.  Enter your bet into the computer by pressing the
red controller button.

If there is more than one player, the last player to make his be erases
any cards from the previous game on the screen.  The Computer then
deals the hand.

Each time you win or lose a hand, your bet is automatically added or
subtracted to your total number of chips on the playfield.


Leaving the Game

If one or more players wish to leave the game (but) wants to save his
Bank) depress the console game select switch four (4) times.  Each
player remaining in the game must then press his controller button and
the game will continue.

The players who have left the game can return by pressing their
controller button before the deal.  The computer will "deal them in"
and display their previous Bank total.


Hit, Stay or Double Down

After players make their bets, the computer deals two cards to each
player.

* If you are satisfied with the points of your first two cards, turn    
  the controller knob until the word STAY appears.  Press the red       
  controller button to indicate your decision.

* If you want another card, turn the controller knob until the word HIT 
  appears.  Press the red controller button and the computer will deal  
  another card to you.  Continue to HIT until you are satisfied with    
  the point value of your hand.  The maximum number of hits allowed for 
  Game 2 is 3.  In Game 1 the number of hits allowed is 3 or 8.

* You may double your bet after the first two cards are dealt.  Turn    
  the controller knob to DBLE.  Then press the red controller button.   
  One more card appears, and no more hits are allowed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Doubling is not allowed when the original bet is more than half
the number of remaining chips.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Splitting

Only Game 1 allows splitting.  When your first two cards have identical
value (i.e. two 5's, or a Jack and King) you can split your cards into
two hands.  Turn the controller knob until the letters SPLIT appear. 
Press the red controller button and the computer deals a card to each
of the SPLIT cards.  Now you play the two sets of cards as separate
hands.  Your original bet is also duplicated for the second card hand.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Splitting is allowed only if the bet is less than half of your
remaining chips.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Insurance

Both Games 1 and 2 allow insurance.  The need for insurance occurs when
the computer dealer's hand shows one face-down card and an Ace...a
possible Black Jack combination.

An "i" will appear on your set-up.  If you wish to protect your bet
from a possible dealer Black Jack, turn the controller knob to INSR and
press the red controller button.  If you wish no insurance, turn the
controller knob until the word PASS appears and press the red
controller button.

The price of insurance is half your bet.  Each player must decide on
insurance.  If the dealer has Black Jack, the dealer's face down card
is shown.  All players lose their original bets.  Players with
insurance win twice the amount of their insurance bets which is equal
to their original bets.

If the dealer does not have a Black Jack, the players with insurance
lose their insurance bets.  The game play continues as each player
decides to hit, stay or double down.



STUD POKER -- GAME 3
--------------------

Game 3 is Stud Poker for one to four players.  Players compete against
the Computer Dealer.  The Computer deals five cards to each player and
five cards to itself.  Before the first card is dealt and after the
second, third, fourth and fifth cards are dealt, players must place
bets or fold (drop out of the game).  The object is to beat the
dealer's five-card hand.  The following chart shows the ranking of
possible card hands starting with the highest valued hand:

     High Card - Example: If a hand has an Ace, 5, 6, 7 and 2, the
     high card is an Ace.  This beats a hand that has no higher card
     combinations.  A hand with and Ace and an 8 (or higher) would be
     this hand.


If your hand ranks higher than the Computer Dealer's, you win an amount
equal to what you bet.  If the Computer's hand beats yours, you lose
your bet.

If your hand and the dealer's hand rank the same, the hand with the
highest value card wins.  If all five cards match in numerical value,
it's a tie game and no scoring change occurs.
