GHOSTBUSTERS II
INSTRUCTIONS
ENGLISH

ONCE UPON A TIME, FIVE YEARS AGO
Manhattan was infested with spook and ghouls of every description.
Slime oozed and squirted from each nook and cranny of the city. The
very atmosphere throbbed with paranormal activity. Gozer, the destroyer
of subcreatures, and his two terror dogs transformed a skyscraper into the
Temple of Zuul. They wanted to take over the world. So who did New
Yorkers call...? The Ghostbusters! Armed with proton packs, they zapped 
and toasted every ghost in town. They even brought a giant marshmallow man 
to life that helped them quell Gozer, and rescue New York and the rest of 
the world from impending doom and destruction !
Five years later, the Ghostbusters have discovered a huge tunnel of slime
running through the old Van Home pneumatic transit line underneath
the city. This time, it's mood slime feeding off the bad vibes, meanness,
rudeness, and general ill-will that permeates the city. 
So, who ya gonna call this time ? The Ghostbusters! Join them in a
precarious, paranormal-filled dangle above the Van Horne tunnel on a
slimescooping mission. March with the Statue of Liberty down Broadway.

LOADING INSTRUCTIONS
1. With your TV off, hook up your video game system to your TV.
2. Plug your joystick in the left hand port.
3. Turn on your TV, and insert the GHOSTBUSTERS II cartridge with
the label facing away from you.
4. Turn on the video game system.

VAN HORNE
It takes slime to battle slime. And Van Horne is where you have to go to
get it. Your object is to make it down the shaft to the river of slime and
take a slime sample.

CONTROLS :
- Use the joystick only to control the Ghostbuster.
- To choose a weapon press the select button on the Atari 2600 Console.
- Press the joystick fire button to fire whatever weapon you've selected.
- To Restart the game press the reset button on the console.

THE SHAFT
- Swing from side to side in the shaft. Ghostbuster's feet must touch the
bonus items on the sides of the shaft in order to pick them up.
- Assemble the slime scooper by collecting all three of its pieces from the
sides of the shaft.
- Stock up on courage-restoring elixir hiding in the nooks and crannies of
the shaft.
- You begin your mission armed with the proton beam and a few PKR
bombs, but you'll need to collect the PKR bombs and shields and extra
proton packs scattered throughout the shaft to effectively fend off the 
supernatural swarms surrounding you.

THE STATUS PANEL

CURRENT WEAPON: Once you've collected your weapons by having
the Ghostbusters touch them with his feet, press the space bar to cycle
through them. Press the joystick fire button to fire the one you selected.
- PROTON BEAM: Use the joystick to swing from side to side and
press the fire button to fire the proton beam.
- PKR BOMBS: hold the fire button and move up or down with the
joystick. When you want the bomb to explode, release the fire button.
- PKR SHIELD : Press the fire button while moving the joystick up or
down.

DEPTH METER: This number shows how far down the shaft you are.

CABLE CONDITION: The cable is endangered by ghostly sawing hands.
This gauge measures the amount of fraying the cable has sustained, and
gives you an idea of how much more it will take.

COURAGE INDICATOR: The indicator shows how much strength the
Ghostbuster has left. The bottles of elixir you collect stave off panic for a
while, at least.

SCOOP: As you collect the parts of the scoop, it's assembled in this window. 
When you have it all together, you'll be able to scoop up the slime
at the bottom of the shaft - if you make it that far.

ON BROADWAY
Miss Liberty unleashes a fire ball from her torch to shoot the ghosts out
of the sky.
Once hit, the ghosts dissolve into globs of slime which stay until a new
wave of ghosts appear. The Ghostbusters march out into the street to
mop them up, which replenishes the slime beaker.

IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THERE IS A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF SLIME:
- If the Statue of Liberty gets hit by a ghost, the slime in the beaker goes
down.
- Libby has a limited number of shots in each fireball. When she runs
out, a new fireball is generated.

CONTROLLING LIBBY
- Use the joystick to aim Libby's fireball-belching torch.
- Toggle the joystick to make the Ghostbusters walk left and right.

Action, Adventure, Strategy challenges - and great laughs
