1. SOCCER FEVER

It's the final game of the season, and once again the championship is at
stake--only this time, it's among old rivals.  A goal by the opposing team
ties the game with one minute to go.  You wipe the sweat off your forehead
as the score flashes across the screen of a giant indoor stadium: Blue
Defenders 2, Red Rebels 2.

With precious seconds ticking away, the crowd is growing restless in the
stands.  The team lines up for the final kick-off.  You hear the SCREECH
of the referee's whistle and the ball shoots towards your center position
with the velocity of a bullet.  You dart forward and kick the ball to a
wing player, but a Rebel skillfully steals it away, leaving you off balance.
Crashing to the side, you hear the ball whizzing past your left ear.

Don't worry!  A player on your team intercepts the ball and kicks it to a
teammate.  But in the tension of the moment, he misses.  You close in from
the wing.  Too late!  A Rebel gets control of the ball and dribbles it
towards your goal.  Like a shadow, you follow close behind.  Only you can
steal the ball and prevent him from scoring a winning point.  In a split
second, your foot snaps the ball from beneath his feet and brilliantly kicks
the ball high across the field.  What a pass!  The crowd rises to their feet,
and cheers, anticipating a possible victory.

With 20 seconds to go, you sprint towards the center of the action.  A star
player for the Rebels tries deflecting the ball to the sideline, but under
pressure from your team, the ball spins towards you.

You rush to meet the ball before your opponents close in.  With a tremendous
low kick, the ball barely leaves the ground as it shoots into the goal.  A
Rebel makes a quick dive and...misses.

The crowd erupts into a frenzy.  Your team has won the game--and the
championship!  Proud fans jump up and down in the stands.  In the resounding
roar, you hear the loud clear chant of VICTORY.

2. GAME PLAY

Soccer players, get ready!  With three players on your team, your objective is
to bluff, pass, and outmaneuver your opponents to score the most points before
the clock runs out.  You score one point for each goal.  Play against the
computer, or play against a friend.

At the start of the game, the ball is placed at the center of the halfway
line.  Blue fielders are on the left side of the line.  Reds on the right.
Either team can take possession of the ball.  Fielders are assigned to one of
three lanes in the playing field and must dribble the ball within their lane
or pass to another fielder (see Figure 1).

Each player controls one fielder at a time.  The computer controls the rest of
the team.  As the offense, you control the player with the ball.  As the
defense, you can switch control from one player to another by pressing the
button on your Joystick controller (see Section 3, USING THE CONTROLLERS).

You can use the wraparound feature in RealSports SOCCER to run your player off
one side of the screen to have him reappear on the other side of the screen.
When using this feature, the controlled player must not be in possession of
the ball.  A controlled player can run off either side of the screen, but
cannot run off the end of the field.

Only your controlled player can score a goal (see Figure 2).  But watch out!
If the ball doesn't go all the way into the goal, a defensive player can still
block the goal and take control of the ball.  If the ball does go in, you'll
hear the shriek of the referee's whistle.  You score 1 point, the clock stops,
and the ball is turned over to the other team for the kick-off.

The referee's whistle sounds off at three different times throughout the game:
at kick-off, after goals, and at the end of the game.  Game play lasts for 5
minutes or 9 minutes, depending on the game you choose (see Section 5, GAME
VARIATIONS).

3. USING THE CONTROLLERS

Use your Joystick Controllers with this ATARI Game Program(TM) cartridge.  Be
sure the controller cables are firmly plugged into the CONTROLLER jacks at the
back of your Video Computer System(TM) game.  Use the Joystick plugged into
the LEFT CONTROLLER jack for one-player games: plug an additional Joystick
into the RIGHT CONTROLLER jack for two-player games.  Hold the Joystick with
the red button towards your upper left, toward the television screen. (See
your owner's manual for further details).

Use your Joystick to move your controlled player in the direction you want the
player to run or to dribble the ball. (Notice that controlled players appear
brighter than their teammates).  To KICK or PASS, point the Joystick in the
direction you want the ball to go, and press the controller button.  Fielders
miust touch the ball with their legs to have control; the ball cannot be
passed or blocked with any other part of the body.

DEFENSE

When playing defense, you can switch control from one player to another.  Press
the controller button until the desired player appears brighter.  Notice that
the control switches from player to player in sequence (see Figure 3).  When
you are ready to steal the ball, run your controlled player into the ball.

OFFENSE

When playing offense, your controlled player moves slower than the defensive
controlled player.  Pass the ball to a teammate to avoid a steal or to move
the ball into another lane.  The receiving fielder automatically becomes a
controlled player (see Figure 4).

5. GAME VARIATIONS

RealSports(TM) SOCCER can be played by two players or by one player against
the computer.  In one-player games, the computer controls the red team.
Each game has 3 skill levels and playing option of 5 minutes or 9 minutes.

As you progress through each level of difficulty, game play speeds up, and
in one-player games the computer's teamwork becomes quicker and more skillful.

6. GAME STRATEGY AND TIPS

* RealSports(TM) SOCCER is full of surprises.  Your only limitation is time!
Try moving the ball from foot-to-foot, or reversing your direction
unexpectedly. BLUFFING your opponent is a good way to distract him while you
pass the ball to another teammate.

* Passing is essential since a defensive fielder can always outrun the player
with the ball.  The easiest way to improve your passing is to practice in
two-player games without another player.  This way, you won't have to worry
about interceptions.

* Defend your goal!  Remember your controlled player's feet must touch the
ball in order to block a goal.

* In defensive play, you can usually outrun your opponent.  Just stay in
front, and you're sure to win!  And don't forget to practice intercepting and
stealing the ball--then pass it to a teammate!
