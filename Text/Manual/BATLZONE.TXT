THE EXPLOSIVE ARCADE HIT!
BATTLEZONE(TM)

NOTE: Always turn the console POWER switch OFF when inserting or removing
an ATARI(R) Game Program(TM) cartridge. This will protect the electronic
components and prolong the life of your ATARI Video Computer System(TM)
game.

GAME OBJECTIVE

The year is 1999, and the nations of the earth have declared a world-wide
peace plan. But there is a problem with the proposed truce. A council of
military commanders has unleashed battalions of automated weapons into the
countryside. These aerial fighters, flying saucers, tanks, and supertanks
will turn the world into a lifeless landscape unless you can stop them.

Luckily, you've discovered an old military tank hidden inside the museum.
Use your Joystick to steer the tank as you search for enemy automatons.
Since your electronic periscope only gives you a front view from the tank,
you'll have to rely heavily on your radar screen to detect the enemy. If
you see a blip on the radar, you need to move fast! Use your Joystick to
turn your tank until the enemy appears on the screen; press the red
controller button to fire your turret gun.

GAME PLAY

You have five tanks to complete your mission. Your tank will be destroyed
each time it is hit by enemy fire.

The enemies you'll encounter are:

TANKS
Tanks are your most common enemy. They move a bit slower than your tank,
and can be identified by their blue turrets.

SUPERTANKS
These look like regular tanks, but have yellow turrets and can move faster
than your tank.

FIGHTERS
Fighters always appear directly in front of you then zigzag toward your
tank. When a fighter reaches point-blank range, it will veer to the side
and fire an anti-tank shell directly at you. You can identify a fighter by
the "buzz" sound it makes as it flies.

FLYING SAUCERS Flying saucers do not fire at you, but are hard to hit and
can distract you when a tank, a fighter, or a supertank is firing at you.

(Note: Colors may vary with different television sets.)

USING YOUR RADAR SCREEN

Your radar is located at the top center of the screen. Enemy automatons
appear on the screen as white "blips" of light, your tank is located in the
middle of the radar circle. The two lines at the top of the radar screen
indicate your field of view. When you move your tank so an enemy "blip" is
between the lines, you should be able to see the enemy on the main screen.
Be careful, though! An enemy can shoot and destroy your tank -- even if you
can't see it on the main screen.

A black sighting mark is located at the top of the main screen to help you
aim at the target. When the enemy is directly in your line of fire, the
sighting mark will change from black to white.

SCORING

USING THE CONTROLLER

Use your Joystick to maneuver your tank. Plug the Joystick firmly into the
LEFT controller jack at the back of your console. Hold the controller with
the red button to your upper left, toward the television screen.

Push forward on your Joystick to move your tank forward; pull back on the
Joystick to move your tank backward. To rotate your tank in position, push
the Joystick directly right or left. Move the tank in an arc by pushing
your Joystick diagnally in the desired direction.

Fire your turret gun by pressing the red button on your controller. If you
miss a target, you cannot fire again for approximately 2 seconds.

STRATEGY

   * A good way to evade enemy shells is to rotate your tank 45 degrees,
     then immediately move the tank forward or backward.

   * Listen for the sound of an enemy gun being fired. As soon as you hear
     a shot, take evasive action. Do not simply rotate in the same spot.

   * Keep moving after you fire a shot -- don't want to see if the shot hit
     its mark.

   * If a tank is close behind, you can bring it within sight by moving
     your tank in reverse until the enemy tank appears on the screen.
     You'll be able to shoot as the enemy tank turns to face you.

   * Try to lure one enemy into another enemy's line of fire. For example,
     by moving your tank to one side, you can move a flying saucer into a
     shot fired by an enemy tank.

   * Don't waste shots, since you can't shoot your turret gun again until
     the shell either hits an enemy, or disappears from your main screen.
