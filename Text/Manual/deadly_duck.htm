<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">GAME INSTRUCTIONS<br>
_____________________________________________________________________<br>
</font><font size="4" face="Courier New"><strong>DEADLY DUCK</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>TO SET UP:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Set up your video computer system and left joystick
controller as indicated in your manufacturer's manual. Turn OFF the power switch and
insert the Deadly Duck game cartridge.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>TO BEGIN:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Turn On the power and choose a level of play. (The
Difficulty Switches are not used in Deadly Duck.) Press the joystick button or the Game
Reset lever to leave the &quot;Demo Mode&quot; and prepare for a round of Deadly Duck, the
game that'll quack you up!</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>THE OBJECTIVE:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Deadly Duck's job is to score points by blasting his
enemy the Crabs, their Bricks and the Dragonflies. Deadly can keep shooting as long as he
avoids getting bonked by a falling Brick or hit by a Dragonfly's Bomb.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>THE CONTROLS:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Tilt the joystick left or right to make Deadly Duck
swim back and forth across the pond. Press the joystick button once to deliver one
&quot;Bill Bullet&quot; or hold the button down for non-stop firing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>PLAY LEVELS:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">At any time during the game, play levels may be
selected by using the Game Select lever. Deadly will automatically advance to the next
level of difficulty after eliminating all eight Crabs. The play level is indicated by the
number of Dragonflies shown.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Level 1 = 0 Dragonflies<br>
Level 2 = 2 Dragonflies, 1 Bomb dropped at a time<br>
Level 3 = 4 Dragonflies, 2 Bombs dropped at a time<br>
Level 4 = 6 Dragonflies, 3 Bombs dropped at a time</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>DEADLY DUCK:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">You begin with four Deadly Ducks and receive a bonus
Duck for shooting all eight Crabs in each play level. Although you may acquire an
unlimited supply of extra Ducks, no more than three will be shown at the bottom of the
screen.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>CRABS &amp; BRICKS:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">There are eight crusty Crabs in each level of Deadly
Duck who want to dunk Deadly with their Bricks. These Bricks will float on the water for a
short time, temporarily blocking Deadly's movement on the pond. An &quot;on target&quot;
Brick means good-bye to our feathered friend.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>DRAGONFLIES:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Dragonflies are allies of the cranky old Crabs and
cannot be destroyed. They should be approached with caution. If one is hit with a Bill
Bullet you gain ten points, but beware, the now angry dragonfly will drop a bomb aimed
directly at poor Deadly.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>SCORING:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The current score is located at the bottom of the
screen. Be sure to record your high scores on the back of this folder!</font></p>

<pre>Brick Shot       =  50 points in Level 1
                   100 points in Level 2
                   200 points in Level 3
                   500 points in Level 4
1 Crab Shot      =  30 points in all levels
1 Dragonfly Shot =  10 points in all levels</pre>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>HINTS FROM THE DESIGNER...</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Practice shooting bricks on Level 1 until you can hit
them fairly easily. Be careful, since attempting to shoot a brick can be dangerous if you
miss. After you've developed some confidence in your ability to shoot bricks, start a new
game, but this time go through the first three levels before trying to shoot bricks. Now
the bricks are worth 500 points and you should have a few more Ducks in reserve.</font></p>
