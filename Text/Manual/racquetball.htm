<strong><big><big>RACQUETBALL</big></big></strong>

You are a racquetball player, and you have accepted the challenge
of a formidable opponent. Both combatants enter the arena through
the opening in the wall, and the frenzied game begins with the
crack of the racquet against the first ball. The pace is fast and
furious as the ball recoils from the backboard at ninety miles
per hour. Are you fast enough to react in time to return the
ball? Can you endure the fast pace and vanquish the opponent? If
you are willing to try, it will leave you as breathless as a real
game on a real court. WARNING: Don't let your opponent ace you...

THE SET-UP

Racquetball is played with one or two players using the Joystick
Controller. Be sure the power is off when you insert or remove
Racquetball from your video game system.

THE DIFFICULTY SWITCH

Placing the difficulty switch in the &quot;B&quot; position will allow the
player to more easily control his shots, while accuracy is more
difficult in the &quot;A&quot; mode.

You may vary the positions of the Difficulty Switches to provide
a handicap advantage for a less experienced player in a two
player game. Simply place the switch in position B for the
inexperienced player, and position A for the veteran.

THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLER

Hold your Joystick Controller so that the red &quot;FIRE&quot; button is
in the upper lefthand corner. Use your joystick to move your
player across the floor of the court. He can move in any of eight
different directions as illustrated above. In one-player games,
the computer controls the right player/joystick.

RACQUET STROKES
Start your serve by pressing the red button. To hit the ball,
move your player to make contact between his racquet and the
ball. NOTE: You will know that you have moved your player into
range to hit the ball when the ball's shadow is at about the same
level as the player's feet. The racquet will swing automatically
when the player is moved into range to hit the ball.

SCORING

Scoring is identical with the official racquetball rules. When
you serve the ball, it must hit the front wall before touching
the floor. The other player can return the ball before it bounces
on the floor, but must not let it bounce on the floor twice. You
serve until you miss. If you are serving when your opponent
misses, you get one point. NOTE: You only make points when you
are serving. The first player earning twenty-one points wins.
