               SPACE VOYAGE INSTRUCTIONS

OBJECTIVE

Pilot Star Voyager through treacherous space. As you look out from the Command Bridge, stars rush past.
Penetrate the seven star portals and save the Capital Starport. Destroy enemy ships with photon torpedoes or
lasers, or evade them to maintain your precious energy supply.
Keep track of energy levels on the instrument panel. Use your radar screen to locate opponents and
approaching star portals. Only passing through a star portal restores your energy reserves. But be warned!
Crashing into a star portal will destroy you!

GAME PLAY

* Your viewer displays the hostile space you navigate.
* Sights at the center of the viewer show where your 2 lines of fire meet.
* Weapon fire originates under wings located on either side of the Command Bridge. Lasers use more energy
  than photon torpedoes but have a wider, more effective range. Both destroy anything in their paths.
* Enemy ships and star portals first appear as small distant dots, then advance. Enemy pulsar bombs flash
  white hot on your viewer. Each hit costs you energy as enemy ships and their fire crash into Star Voyager
  defense shields.
Destroy enemy ships, maintain enery levels, eclipse star portals - you'll earn field promotions. (See Scoring)
* Your Instrument Panel helps. The reading on the left indicates the number of enemy ships you've blasted.
  Energy still in reserve appears on the right.
* The radar screen in the middle of the panel shows both the nearest enemy (solid dot) and star portal
  (flashing blip).
* Audio signals alert you to approaching foes and star portals. Four beeps indicate an alien presence. A
  musical overtune sounds when a star portal is near.
* Your joystick responds like pilot controls. To navigate: pull stick toward you to climb. Push forward to
  dive. Rotate to the right and veer right; to the left, veer left. Position joystick controller so that the red
  button is at the upper left hand corner.
