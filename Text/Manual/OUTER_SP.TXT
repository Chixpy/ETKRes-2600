                                OUTER SPACE

by: Sears (Atari Star Ship)

for 1 or 2 players

Use your Joystick Controllers with this game program. Be sure the
Controllers are firmly connected to your Video Arcade jacks. See page 4 in
the Owner's Manual for details. Hold the Controllers with the red button to
your upper left towards the television screen.

NOTE: The Console unit should be OFF when inserting or removing a game
program.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTROLLER ACTION

Controller action depends on the game being played. Details for Joystick
Controller action action can be be found under each game heading.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SKILL OPTIONS

Want to really test your aim in space? Slide the Skill switch to the
"Expert" position. Your laser missiles are weaker, making it necessary for
you to hold the UFO on target longer.

Slide the Skill switch to "Expert" position during Lunar Lander games and
you must be exactly on target before you score points. As you attempt to
land the Lunar Lander on the moon, make sure that you are landing DIRECTLY
on the moon target as you fire the landing rockets with the red Controller
button.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPACE WAR

You're sitting in your space ship cockpit. And your television screen is
suddenly transformed into the window of your Space Ship. With the Joystick
Controller, steer the ship deep into space. A constant barrage of meteors
whiz towards your window. And eerie UFOs float from the darkest parts of
space.

The movement of the Joystick affects the direction you travel through
space. For example, to avoid collision with space objects on your ship's
let, steer the ship to the right by moving the Joystick to the right; dive
by moving the Joystick forward; soar upward by moving the Joystick back
towards you.

Joystick Action [Image of a cross with the directions labeled: JOYSTICK
FORWARD TO DIVE (Moves Objects Up) {at top of cross}. JOYSTICK LEFT TO TURN
LEFT (Moves Objects Right) {at left of the cross}. JOYSTICK RIGHT TO TURN
RIGHT (Moves Objects Left) {at right of the cross}. JOYSTICK BACK TO CLIMB
(Moves Objects Down) {at the bottom of the cross}.

Your mission in space is to destroy the space UFOs and score points. You
are helpless against asteroids--they can NOT be destroyed. Lose one point
when any UFO or asteroid crashes into your ship. Score one point when you
destroy a Space Fighter. Score two points when you zap a flying saucer or
space module. A space robot is worth three points when you destroy it.

Destroy UFOs with laser beams fired by pressing the red button on your
Joystick Controller. Laser beams are only effective when the objects are in
the target area--the two center bars of the Space Window. Zap a UFO and
your score appears at the top right of the screen.

While you blast through space, you'll hear space sounds: computer "BEEPS"
from your space ship controls, collisions and laser beams when you fire.

Asteroid--Cannot be destroyed. [Image of an asteroid. It is a circle that
is made of 12 dots.]

Space Fighter--1 point. [Image of a space fighter. It is a big Z with a
ball on the top, left corner.]

Flying Saucer--2 points. [Image of a flying saucer. It looks like a hat.]

Space Robot--3 points. [Image of a space robot. It looks like a diamond
with arms, legs, and a set of antennas.]

Space Module--2 points. [Image of a space module. It looks like the flying

One-Player Games of Space War

You are all alone on these Space War games. Your television screen becomes
your Space Ship Window as you guide your ship deep into space with the
right Joystick Controller. Meteors whiz past you. And on each mission, UFOs
take a different strategy.

Score points by destroying UFOs. Just press the red Controller button when
the UFO is in the target area and ZAPPP! All one-player Space Wars last two
minutes and 16 seconds. During the final 16 seconds, your score flashes off
and on the Space Window.

Space Window for Games 1, 2, 3, 4. [Image of the tv screen with a flying
saucer, asteroid, laser sights, and lasers.]

GAME 1 - Space War

Your mission is to destroy as many SLOW MOVING SPACE UFOs as possible in 2
minutes and 16 seconds. The UFOs appear two at a time as you guide your
ship into space.

GAME 2 - Outer Space

Your mission is to destroy as many SLOW MOVING SPACE UFOs as possible in 2
minutes and 16 seconds. They appear one at a time as you guide your ship
into space.

GAME 3 - Super Space War

Your mission is to destroy as many FAST MOVING UFOs as possible in 2
minutes and 16 seconds. They appear one at a time.

GAME 4 - Double Space War

Your mission is to destroy as many FAST MOVING UFOs as possible in two
minutes and 16 seconds. They appear two at a time.

Two-player Games of Space War

You are sitting in your Space Ship cockpit. Use the right Joystick
Controller to guide the Space Ship. The opponent uses the other Joystick
Controller to steer the Space Module that appears through the Space Window.
Your score appears in the top right corner of the Space Window. The
opponent's score is in the left corner.

fighter, space robot, space module, laser sights, and lasers.]

Only the Space Ship Commander can score in this game. But both players have
a turn to be Commander of the Space Ship. This Space War lasts 4 minutes
and 32 seconds. During the final 116 seconds of each game half (2 minutes
and 16 seconds), the scores will flash at the top of the screen. After the
first half of the game, the Module in the Space Window changes color from
blue to orange. Then you become Commander of the Module and your opponent
becomes the Space Ship Commander.

Space Module Joystick Action. [Image of a space module next to a cross. The
cross is labeled with joystick directions. JOYSTICK FORWARD, MOVE UP.
JOYSTICK LEFT TO TURN LEFT. JOYSTICK RIGHT TO TURN RIGHT. JOYSTICK BACK,
MOVE DOWN]

Your mission as Space Ship Commander? To destroy UFOs and the Space Module
you can see through your Space Window. As you chase the Module through
space, make points when you zap a UFO or when you destroy the Module. Lose
1 point when you collide with a UFO or asteroid.

As a module Commander, you must avoid collisions and laser missiles from
the Space Ship. The Module's major defense? The ability to become
invisible. The Module Commander presses the red Controller button and the
Module disappears when it is near the target area in the center of the
Space Window. The Space Ship Commander scores 2 points when the Module
collides with a UFO or asteroid.

GAME 5 - Space War II

The space chase is on. And you must destroy the space Module. There are no
UFOs in this galaxy. As Module Commander, you must avoid collisions and
laser missiles.

GAME 6 - Outer Space II

Blast off into space after the space Module. You must destroy the Module
and try to avoid collisions with the indestructible SLOW MOVING ASTEROIDS
that appear. If you are the Module Commander, avoid collisions and laser
missiles.

GAME 7 - Super Space War II

Your mission? To destroy the space Module and try to avoid collisions with
the indestructible FAST MOVING ASTEROIDS that appear. As Module Commander,
you must avoid collisions and laser missiles.

GAME 8 - Space War III

The space chase is on! You must destroy the space Module and the SLOW
MOVING UFOs that appear one at a time from deep space.

GAME 9 - Super Space War III

Catch the space Module. You must destroy it and the FAST MOVING UFOs that
appear one at a time from deep space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPACE RACE (One-Player Games)

You are sitting in your cockpit watching space whiz by. With the right
Joystick Controller, steer your ship past the indestructible asteroids.
Your mission? To cover as much distance as possible.

Your space meter ticks away each parsec (a measure of space distance) of
distance in the upper right corner of the Space Window. You lose one parsec
each time you collide with an asteroid.

To increase your speed in space, press the red Controller button. You'll
hear the engines roar into the fastest speed of all. During the final 16
seconds of each game, your score will flash off and on the top right of the
Space Window. Each game lasts 2 minutes and 16 seconds. Throughout your
space race against time, you'll hear the sound of your Space Ship engines,
computer "BEEPS" from your Space Ship controls, and collisions.

laser sights, and lasers pictured.]

GAME 10 - Space Race

Cover as much distance as possible while avoiding collisions with ASTEROIDS
that appear one at a time.

GAME 11 - Double Space Race

Cover as much distance as possible while avoiding collisions with ASTEROIDS
that appear two at a time.

LUNAR LANDER

You've explored space. Now your mission is to explore the moon. You control
the Lunar Lander on the Space Window with your Controller Joystick. The
game or another player controls the movement of the moon. Score one point
for every successful landing your Lunar Lander makes. Note: When the Lunar
Lander or the Moon is moved off the top bottom or sides of the Space
Window, it will reappear at the opposite side. For example, the Moon moves
off the top of the Window and reappears at the bottom of the Window.

You'll hear space sounds: Computer "BEEPS" from your Lander controls,
collisions and retro fire from your rocket engines.

Moon [Image of the Moon. If looks like a colored in circle with five
squares inside of it not colored in.]

One-Player Games of Lunar Lander

Each one-player games lasts 2 minutes and 16 seconds. The computer controls
the movement of the moon. You control the movement of the Lunar Lander with
the right Controller Joystick. Score one point for every successful landing
your Lander makes. Before you can make a perfect landing, remember to fire
your retro rockets by pressing the red Controller button as you land.

GAME 12 - Simple Lunar Lander

Using the right Controller, you steer the Lunar Lander. The compute
controls the movement of the moon. Score one point for every successful
lading.

GAME 13 -- Complex Lunar Lander

Using the right Controller, you are commander of the Lunar Lander while the
computer moves the moon. Score one point for every successful landing. You
must avoid collision with SLOW MOVING METEOR SHOWERS. Lose one point when
you collide with a meteor. Meteors do not affect the moon.

GAME 14 - Super Lunar Lander

You control the Lunar Lander with the right Controller. The computer
controls the moon. Score one point for every successful landing. You must
avoid collision with FAST MOVING METEOR SHOWERS. Lose one point when you
collide with a meteor. Meteors do not affect the moon.

Two-player Games of Lunar Lander

Control the Lunar Lander with the right Joystick and your score appears in
the top right corner of the Space Window. The other player controls the
moon with the left Joystick and that score appears in the left corner. Only
the Lunar Lander Commander can score one point for each successful moon
landing.

The two-player games last 4 minutes and 32 seconds. After the first half of
the games, the Lunar Lander changes from blue to orange, and the right
joystick controls the moon's movement; the left Joystick then controls the
Lunar Lander. That way, both players have a chance to score. During the
final 16 seconds of each game half (2 minutes an 16 seconds), the score
will flash at the top of the Space Window.

GAME 15 - Simple Lunar Lander

You control the movement of the Lunar Lander. Another player controls the
moon. Score one point for every successful landing. As controller of the
moon, you must try to avoid contact with the Lunar Lander.

GAME 16 - Complex Lunar Lander

Score one point every time you land on the moon. Your only obstacles are
SLOW MOVING METEOR SHOWERS. When the Lunar Lander collides with a meteor,
you lose one point. As controller of the moon, you must try to avoid
contact with the Lunar Lander. Meteor showers do not affect the moon.

GAME 17 - Super Lunar Lander

Score one point every time you land on the moon. You opponent controls the
moon. Your only obstacles are FAST MOVING METEOR SHOWERS. When you collide
with a meteor, you lose one point. As controller of the moon, you must try
to avoid contact with the Lunar Lander. Meteor showers do not affect the
moon.
