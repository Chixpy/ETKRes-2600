1. INTRODUCTION

Join the Atari Aces in the World Series of video baseball--RealSports
BASEBALL!  It's a hot day in the ballpark--you can see the hot dog and soda
pop vendors making their way up and down the bleachers.  The crowd roars after
each pitch, and filling the stadium is the sound of &quot;STEERIKE!  YOU'RE OUT!&quot; 
Down on the field it's a different story--just you and the pitcher facing each
other in an enormous diamond of brown and green.

The roar of the spectators fades into the distance as the pitcher winds up. 
His arm arches back, his leg goes up, and...THUNK!  The ball flashes by and
hits the catcher's glove at 90 miles an hour.  &quot;STEERIKE!&quot;  Another windup,
another 90 mile an hour fastball, and &quot;STEERIKE TWO!&quot;  Gripping the bat
tightly, you stare down at the pitcher, see him wind up, and watch as the ball
seems to float in slow motion down the field toward you.  Everything falls
into place as you swing with perfect timing, feel the contact, and see the
ball sail over the right fielders outstretched glove and over the wall.  HOME
RUN!


======================================================================


2. GAME PLAY

You play RealSports BASEBALL just like real baseball.  The game lasts for nine
innings (or more in the case of a tie score), with each team coming to bat
once during each inning.  The first team up to bat (pink action figures) is
the visiting team, and the last team to bat (yellow action figures) is the
home team.  A team remains at bat until three of its players either strike
out, fly out, or are tagged out.  A base runner may also be &quot;forced out&quot; when
an outfielder with the ball tags the base in front of the runner while another
base runner is occupying the base behind him.  (Force outs are needed to make
those double and triple plays!)

Pitchers can throw either a BALL or a STRIKE.  Three strikes count as an OUT;
four balls count as a WALK.  A walked batter automatically advances to first
base.  If a batter swings at a pitch that is programmed to be a ball, it
counts as a strike.

A batter can also hit a FOUL BALL outside the baselines.  A FOUL BALL is
counted as s strike unless the batter has already made two strikes, in which
case it does not affect the count.


======================================================================


3. USING THE CONTROLLERS

Use your Atari Joystick Controllers with this ATARI(R) Game Program(TM)
cartridge.  Be sure the controller cables are firmly plugged into the
CONTROLLER jacks at the back of your Video Computer System(TM) game.  For one-
player games, use the Joystick plugged into the LEFT CONTROLLER jack.  Hold
the Joystick with the red button to your upper left, toward the television
screen.  (See Section 3 of your Owner's Manual for further details.)

STARTING THE GAME

To start the first inning, press one of the red controller buttons.  The home
team will run to the outfield, the catcher will throw the pitcher a new ball,
and a batter from the visiting team will step up to bat.  PLAY BALL!!

CONTROLLING THE BATTER

Make the batter swing by holding down your controller button and flicking the
Joystick at the same time.  The direction you move the Joystick determines the
direction and trajectory of the ball.

Move the Joystick straight up to bunt the ball; to the right to hit a ground
ball in left field; to the left to hit a ground ball in right field; and
straight back to hit fly balls and home runs.  Fly balls and home runs can
also be hit by moving the Joystick diagonally to the lower left and lower
right; the lower right position hits the ball to left field, and the lower
left position hits to right field.

                                 Bunt
                   Right Field     |     Left Field
                             \           /


                           -       O       -


                              /          \
                 Fly Ball Right     |     Fly Ball Left
                           Fly Ball and Home Run

When an outfielder catches a fly ball, the batter is automatically out.  If
the outfielder misses the ball, however, the ball will sail over the stadium
wall and will be counted as a home run.  When a home run is hit, the ball will
reappear only after the batter has rounded the diamond and touched home base.

The direction of a hit ball can be affected by the timing of your swing.  Like
regular baseball, swinging early will &quot;pull&quot; the ball to left field.  Swinging
late--that is, swinging when the ball is nearly past you--will tend to slice
the ball towards right field.

By careful timing, you should soon be able to hit the ball to any part of the
field.

CONTROLLING THE RUNNER

Once a batter has successfully hit the ball, he becomes a runner.  A runner's
direction is determined by holding the controller button down and pushing the
Joystick to either the right of the left [Right: runner advance, Left: runner
retreat].  After a batter has hit the ball, let the Joystick return to the
neutral (center) position, then push it to the right to make him advance to
first base.  To continue running, keep holding the controller button down and
push the Joystick to the right.  To make a runner retreat--if, for example, he
must go back a base to avoid being tagged out--simply hold down the controller
button and push the Joystick to the left.

STEALING A BASE

Stealing a base is a two-step maneuver: First you transfer control from the
batter to a base runner, then you make him run.  To transfer control, move the
Joystick without holding down the controller button in the direction of the
base that the runner is on.  Move the Joystick right to indicate first base;
up to indicate second base; left to indicate third base; and down to indicate
home plate.  The controlled player will turn slightly brighter in color.

Make the base stealer run by holding the controller button down and pushing
the Joystick to the right.  If the pitcher on the opposing team has the ball
and is not moving, the base runner will steal the base quickly.  If any
outfielder with the ball is moving--running or throwing the ball, for example,
--the runner will move much more slowly towards the base.  Therefore it is
best to steal a base when the pitcher is motionless and &quot;isn't looking.&quot;

After the runner has stolen a base, transfer control back to the batter by
pushing the Joystick straight down.

PITCHING THE BALL

Pitching the ball is also done in two steps: First you program the type of
pitch, then you throw the ball.  As an ace pitcher, you can select a FASTBALL,
a RISER, or a SINKER.  you can also psych out your opponent by throwing an
INTENTIONAL BALL.  Push straight up to pitch a fastball; directly right to
pitch a sinker; directly left pitch a riser; and straight down to pitch an
intentional ball.  An intentional ball will always be counted as a ball unless
the batter swings, in which case it counts as a strike.

Occasionally a batter can hit an intentional ball (just as a real batter can
sometimes hit a ball outside the strike zone), but this happens less than 20%
of the time.  All other pitches delver me strikes than balls.  The percentage
of strikes to balls is randomly controlled by the computer--some days your
fastball will deliver more strikes than your sinker, other days the reverse
will be true.  Experiment to discover your best pitch!

After programming the pitch, throw the ball by holding down the controller
button and lightly flicking the Joystick down.

THROWING THE BALL AROUND THE OUTFIELD

The player with the ball can throw to the pitcher or any of the four basemen. 
To throw to first base, hold down the controller button and push the Joystick
to the right.  To throw to second base push straight up.  To throw to third
base push to the left.  Throw to the catcher at home plate by pushing the
Joystick straight down.  Leave the Joystick in the neutral (center) position
to throw the ball to the pitcher.

Remember to release the controller button after the ball is thrown, or you may
accidentally throw the ball again after it is caught.

If an intended receiver of the ball misses the catch, the ball will roll and
come to a stop on the field.  Pick up the ball by running the controlled
player over it.  You'll hear the &quot;plop&quot; of the ball hitting the glove when it
is picked up.

you can identify a controlled player by color; controlled players are solid
yellow or pink.  Non-controlled players are two-toned white and blue.  If
you're in doubt, move the Joystick to see which team member is under your
control.

RUNNING IN THE OUTFIELD

Use your Joystick to move a controlled player in the outfield.  The player
moves up, down, right, left, and diagonally in the same direction you move the
Joystick.


======================================================================


4. CONSOLE CONTROLS

GAME SELECT SWITCH

To select the RealSports BASEBALL game variation you want to play, press the
GAME SELECT switch.  The game variation number will appear on the screen
bottom.  Continue pressing the switch until the game variation you want to
play is displayed.  (See Section 6, GAME VARIATIONS for further information.)

GAME RESET SWITCH

Once you've decided on a game variation, press either the GAME RESET switch or
the red controller button to start game play.

TV TYPE SWITCH

Set this switch to COLOR if you're playing on a color television set.  Set it
to B/W to play the game in black and white.

DIFFICULTY SWITCHES

The LEFT and RIGHT DIFFICULTY switches have no function in this game.


======================================================================


5. SCORING

Each time a batter touches all the bases in a counterclockwise direction and
returns to home plate, the team scores one point.  Scores are kept on the top
of the screen; the home team on the left and visiting team on the right.  The
number of outs in the inning also appears on the top of the screen, between
the two scores.

Balls and strikes are recorded behind home plate on the bottom of the screen. 
the umpire's calls flash after each pitch on the bottom of the screen.

The umpire also calls out the inning number every time a team has three outs
and runs to the outfield.  Look at the bottom of the screen to see the inning
number flash onto the screen before the first pitch.


======================================================================


6. GAME VARIATIONS

There are four game variations in RealSports BASEBALL: Two 2-player games and
two 1-player games.  In the 1-player version the computer automatically
controls one team.  The computer always knows what pitch you're about to
throw, so you'll have to brush up on your best baseball strategy to beat the
computer!

The variations are as follows:
GAME 1   2-player game     Left player starts in the outfield.
                           Right player starts at batch.
                           Batter can hit every pitch.
GAME 2   2-player game     Left player starts at bat.
                           Right player starts in the outfield.
                           Batter cannot hit balls.
GAME 3	  1-player game     Player starts in the outfield.
                           Batter cannot hit balls.
GAME 4   1-player game     Player starts at bat.
                           Batter cannot hit balls.


======================================================================


7. HELPFUL HINTS

1.  Hold the controller in your hands so that your opponent can't see what
direction you're moving your Joystick.  If you're pitching, this will prevent
your opponent from knowing what type of pitch you're going to throw.  If
you're at bat, this will prevent your opponent from noticing if you're about
to steal a base.

2.  When stealing a base, try to steal when the pitcher has the ball and is
motionless (two-toned).  This will allow you to steal the base faster.  But
watch out!  If the pitcher sees you and throws the ball, you'll slow down in
mid-run!

3.  Trust your Joystick when throwing a ball to a base, even though the
direction may not seem right.  Pushing the Joystick UP, for example, will
always throw the ball to second base, even if the outfielder is at the top of
your screen.

MORE HELPFUL HINTS

1.  If you can't make the batter swing, he probably is not a controlled
player.  Push the Joystick down without holding the controller button; then
try swinging the bat using both the Joystick and the controller button.

2.  If no batter appears at home plate after an out, throw the ball to the
catcher and then back to the pitcher. A batter will run out to home plate.

3.  Occasionally a missed ball will roll near an object on the field and will
be hard to see.  Simply run the controlled player over the area the ball was
last seen to pick the ball up.

4.  To make sure the pitcher has the ball, press the red controller button
once.

5.  If the pitcher has the ball and is being controlled, you must run him back
to the pitchers mound to resume pitching.  When he is positioned on the mound,
he'll turn back to blue and white and will be ready to pitch once again.

6.  If an outfielder throws a hit ball back to the pitcher before the batter
starts running, the batter is counted out.
