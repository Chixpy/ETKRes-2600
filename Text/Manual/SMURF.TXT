GAME DESCRIPTION

                         [another smurfy picture]

In Coleco's SMURF(tm) RESCUE IN GARGAMEL'S(tm) CASTLE, treacherous
Gargamel(tm) has captured Smurfette(tm).  He keeps her trapped on a shelf high
above his laboratory floor.  To reach the castle laboratory, nimble-footed
Smurf(tm) must run and jump through fields, woods and caverns.  That's not
all, either!  He must climb, tall mountains and duck dangers in the forest
paths.  Help Smurf(tm) dodge the hawks, snakes, bats and scary spiders
Gargamel(tm) sends from the castle!  Once in the laboratory, Smurf(tm) jumps
to the bench, to the table, to the chair.  He must even jump to the shelf to
free the captive Smurfette(tm)!  Can you make all these jumps and Smurf(tm)
the day?

    Running:
     Push the Control Stick left or right to move Smurf(tm) in that direction.
    Ducking:
     Push the Control Stick down to make Smurf(tm) duck.
    Jumping:
     Push the Control Stick up when Smurf(tm) stands still to make him jump in 
     place.  Push it up while Smurf(tm) is running to make him jump forward.  
     Push it up again immediately after Smurf(tm) lands from a jump to make 
     Smurf(tm) do a bigger jump forward.

HERE'S HOW TO PLAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing up.
------------
When you turn the game on, one Smurf(tm) head, representing one player, and
the words, "Skill 1" appear at the top of the screen.  (This indicates the
Skill 1, one-player game option.)  If you want to play a higher Skill Level or
a two-player game, press the Game Select Button until the Skill Level and
number of players (as shown by one or two Smurf(tm) heads) you want appear
onscreen.  Then press the Red Button to complete your choice.

NOTE: If you are playing a two-player game, players take turns.  Player 1
begins, and each turn lasts until the player's Smurf(tm) gets tired.

Smurfing(tm) after her.
-----------------------
Your first Smurf(tm) appears near his mushroom home in the woods. 
Smurfette(tm)--held captive by Gargamel(tm)--is far, far away to the right.

Help Smurf(tm) travel through woods, fields and mountains, even through dark
and creepy caverns, on his way to the spooky castle.

These forests can be quite dangerous for travelers.  But Gargamel's(tm)
creatures and tricks make the journey even more difficult!  Magic fences
sometimes appear and disappear and snakes can cross water.  When a fence
disappears, there's no need to jump over the empty space!  (Skill 1 games are
a little easier.   In these there are no creatures to chase you.)

If you see dangers, you can ravel back toward home to escape!  It's okay to
outsmart Gargamel's(tm) evil creatures by running and jumping back the way you
came.  But stay alert!  The creatures can follow you.  You get n points for
jumping hazards that you've jumped before.

Remember, when creatures come out, Smurf(tm) has to make the right kinds of
jumping and ducking moves to escape them.

                    WHERE DID SMURFETTE(tm) GO?
                    ---------------------------


                       [smurfy screen shot]


Smurf(tm) be nimble!  Smurf(tm) be quick!
-----------------------------------------
Smurf's(tm) nimble feet must jump him past dangers everywhere.  Short jumps
bounce Smurf(tm) straight up so he can dodge hawks and bats.  Walking, then
jumping quickly lets Smurf(tm) make a bigger jump.  Jumping quickly twice in a
row makes the second jump the biggest of all!  Learn to take just the right
size jumps (big or small) to take him over picket fences and streams, even up
he steep mountains.  And remember to duck when bats or Gargamel's(tm) pet
hawks swoop low.

If Smurf(tm) falls or is knocked down by a snake, bat, hawk or spider, he
feels too tired to travel farther.  Then another Smurf(tm) must try to rescue
Smurfette(tm).

                     IT'S A ROCKY RESCUE JOURNEY!


            [Yes, yet another smurfy B&W screen drawing]


Keep Smurf's(tm) energy up!
---------------------------
Watch the Energy Level Indicator on your screen.  It drops low when Smurf(tm)
gets tired in his travels.  But the moment Smurf(tm) enters a new land (woods,
fields, mountains, caverns or Gargamel's(tm) laboratory), he feels better and
his energy level goes right back up!

Smurfing(tm) into the dreary castle
-----------------------------------
Smurf(tm) crosses the last of the fields, moving closer and closer to
Gargamel's(tm) castle.  Just a few jumps and Smurf(tm) is inside!

Oh no!  How big the chairs and table seem!  And high on a shelf stands brave
Smurfette(tm), guarded by the castle bat.  (Sometimes mean Gargamel(tm) even
makes her disappear momentarily!)  Can you help Smurf(tm) jump to save her and
Smurf(tm) the day?

                   GARGAMEL'S CREEPY LABORATORY.
