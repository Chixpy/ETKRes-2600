WORM WAR I
 
TO SET UP:
Set up your video game system and joystick controllers as instructed in
your manufacturer's owner manual. (Use the left joystick controller
for one player.) Turn the power off and insert the Worn War I game
cartridge.
 
TO BEGIN:
Turn the power ON and choose the Difficulty Level (or Player Skill Level)
and Play Option you want. Press the Game Reset lever to leave the
"Demo Mode" and get ready to do battle with the hideous giant worms
of Teriyaki!
 
THE OBJECTIVE:
Your mission, as a master tank commander, is to drive through the city
of Teriyaki and blast away as many Worms and Blocks as possible
without running out of fuel.
 
THE CONTROLS:
Tilt your joystick left and right to pilot your tank back and forth across 
the screen. Tilt the joystick forward to speed up and backward to slow
down. Press the joystick button once for a single shot or hold the button
down for rapid fire.
 
PLAY OPTIONS:
Use the Game Select lever to choose a play option at any time during
the game.
 
SINGLE PLAYER OPTIONS:
OPTION 1: The "Obstacle Course" begins with side Wall Segments and
a clear playing screen. Obstacles appear after the first group of Worms
are demolished and grow denser each round.
 
OPTION 2: The "Straightaway" maintains a clear playing screen.
 
OPTION 3: "Invisible Worms" uses the Option 1 playing screen, but
Worms are only visible during brief flashes that light up the screen.
 
2 PLAYER COOPERATIVE OPTIONS:
In the cooperative options, the two tanks drivers SHARE fuel and points.
OPTION 4 uses the same screen as in Option 1.
OPTION 5 uses the same screen as in Option 2.
OPTION 6 uses the same screen as in Option 3.
 
2 PLAYER COMPETITIVE OPTIONS:
In the competitive options, each tank driver has a separate fuel and
score tally.
OPTION 7 uses the same screen as in Option 1.
OPTION 8 uses the same screen as in Option 2.
OPTION 9 uses the same screen as in Option 3.
 
DIFFICULTY/PLAYER SKILL SWITCHES
The LEFT Difficulty Switch (or Player Skill Switch) controls the Worm
MOVEMENT.
A (or up)   = Random Worm Movement
B (or down) = Fixed Worm Movement
 
The RIGHT Difficulty Switch (or Player Skill Switch) control the Tank
movement RESPONSE.
A (or up)   = Slower Brake Response
B (or down) = Faster Brake Response
 
FUEL:
As each battle begins you tank is filled with 99 fuel units. You lose 
fuel by moving forward and by crashing into obstacle Blocks or giant
Worms. You can refuel by driving through Pagoda Gas Station. The
faster you drive through, the more fuel you get, though your tank can
carry no more than 99 units. The fuel gauge is located at the top of the
screen. Worm War I ends when you run out of fuel, or, in option 7, 8 and
9 when both players' tanks are empty.
 
FUEL CHART:
Running into a Worm = 10 fuel points lost
Running into a Block = 5 fuel points lost
Moving forward one Wall Segment = 1 fuel point lost
Driving through a Gas Station = 1 to 12 gained
 
SCORING:
The more Worms you rack up, the higher your score. The Worms will
always attack in groups. Each group begins with the appearance of one
Worm on the screen, the two Worms and then three on up to six Worms
at once! You earn 20 points for each Worm shot in the first attack group.
The Worm point value increases AND bonus points are awarded after
each group is destroyed.
 
You can also get points for blasting down obstacle Blocks. Blocks are 
always worth 5 points apiece.  Be sure to record your high scores on the
back of this folder!
 
HINTS FROM THE DESIGNER...
To avoid being totally clobbered by hordes of Worms, pull back on the
stick whenever a new group is appearing.
 
If a fuel Pagoda appears on top of a Block, carefully shoot away the
Block, or try just to nick the Pagoda.
 
When you are refueling, you are safe from collisions. Use this to move 
over inconvenient Blocks.
 
The far left and right sides of the screen are safe spots, but don't hang
there too long. If you don't shoot Worms, you won't bring on any Pagodas.
 
Have a good time and show those Worms who's boss.
