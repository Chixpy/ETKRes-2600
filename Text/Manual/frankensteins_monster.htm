<p align="center">Frankenstein's Monster<br>
Deactivation Instructions<br>
</b></p>

<p>In the cold dark night you make your way through the ghoulish castle of Dr.
Frankenstein. There you must prevent him from completing his creation. </p>

<p>Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where
you must build a barricade around FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER before he has accumulated enough
energy to come alive. To succeed you will have to move fast, avoiding poisonous spiders,
vampire bats and terrifying ghosts. Complete the job and the village will be safe forever.
</p>

<p align="center"><b>Fiend Foiling Objective </b></p>

<p>You must build a barrier around FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER before he is completely
energized. </p>

<p>Player - Player must collect stones from the dungeons of Dr. Frankenstein's castle and
bring them to the tower where he must construct the barrier around FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER.
</p>

<p>Frankenstein's Monster - A grotesque creature that is slowly being energized. Once
completely energized, he will come alive and direct his fury on the helpless villagers. </p>

<p>Power Probe - This device absorbs the energy released by an electrical storm and
distributes it to FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER </p>

<p><b>Ghoulish Creatures to Avoid </b></p>

<p>Ghost - Whether real or mere illusion, these characters are equally terrifying. Contact
one of them and you'll become mesmerized for a short time. </p>

<p>Giant Tarantula - These creatures crawl freely throughout the castle. Avoid them or
their venom will temporarily immobilize you. </p>

<p>Spider - The dungeons of the castle are infested with these crafty pests. Without
warning they'll drop upon you from the cracks in the stone ceiling. They seem determined
to drive you into the deadly pool of acid. </p>

<p>Bat - Lurking in the dark corners are scores of bloodthirsty vampire bats who will
swarm you as you make your final assault on FRANKENSTEIN'S MOSNTER. </p>

<p><b>How to Stop Frankenstein's Monster </b>

<ol>
  <li>Hook up your video game system according to the manufacturer's instructions. </li>
  <li>With game console off, firmly insert you FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER game cartridge. </li>
  <li>Turn game console power on. The game scene should appear. It will be in a standby mode.
    If no picture appears, check to make sure your game unit is hooked correctly to your TV,
    then try steps 1 through 3 again. </li>
  <li>Adjust the &quot;Brightness&quot; control on your TV for best contrast. </li>
  <li>Plug your joystick controller into the left receptacle of your console. For two players,
    use both joystick controllers. Player 1 uses the left controller and Player 2 uses the
    right controller. </li>
  <li>Depress &quot;GAME SELECT&quot; switch for one or two player option. The number of
    players will appear on the top of your screen. </li>
  <li>Select your level of difficulty by positioning the &quot;DIFFICULTY&quot; switch at
    either Level A (for Advanced) or Level B (for Beginners). </li>
  <li>Depress the GAME RESET switch, then press the red fire control button on your joystick
    controller to start game play. Lightning will periodically flash acros the screen toward
    the power proobe which in turn will start to energize the Monster. As the Monster absorbs
    this energy he will slowly turn a green coloe. When he is completely green he will come
    alive and break away from the castle. Your objective is to prevent this from happening by
    constructing a wall around the Monster. <p>If your difficulty switch is set for beginners
    you will have 8 1/2 minutes to finish the wall. In the advanced level you will only have 5
    minutes. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Use your joystick controller and make your way to the lower level of the castle and pick
    up the stone shown at the lower right hand corner of your screen. Avoid falling through
    trapdoors or contacting ghosts and spiders. They will lower your score and slow you down.
    You can either avoid them or use your fire control button to jump over the. NOTE: You
    cannot jump over the ghost. <p>Once you have retrieved the stone you must make your way
    back to the top of the castle. To climb up through a trap door, press the red fire control
    button while holding the joystick in the forward position. When you reach the top of the
    castle you must make your way behind the green-colored wall. At this point Scene 2 will
    appear and you will be swarmed by vampire bats. Continue through the swarm toward the
    Monster. At each side of the Monster there will be a small footing where you must place
    your stone. If you succeed the screen will change back to Scene 1, which will show the
    beginnings of a wall on both sides of the Monster. To finish the wall you must repeat the
    above process 6 times. Each time will be more difficult. </p>
  </li>
  <li>If you fall into the pool of acid you will lose one turn. If in a single player mode,
    the game will automatically move onto your next turn. <b>The timer does not stop.</b> If
    there are two players, the game will automatically shift to player two's turn at which
    time his timer will start. When a player loses three turns the game will be over. Depress
    the RESET button and start a new game. </li>
</ol>

<p>In this game you will start with 500 points. Each time you run into a ghost or a spider
you will lose 20 points. Each time you contact a bat you will lose 10 points. Falling
through a trapdoor will cost you 100 points. If you are unfortunate enought to fall into
the pool of acid, you will lose 200 points and one of your three lives. </p>

<p>For each stone you place around the Monster, you will gain a bonus of 500 points.
Finally, if you finish the job before your time runs out, you will gain a bonus of 100
points for each unit of time saved. NOTE: It takes 30 units of time to energize the
Monster. </p>

<p><b>Additional Fiend Foiling Strategies </b></p>

<p>The primary objective in this game is to beat the timer and enclose the Monster. A
secondary objective is to complete the primary objective with the highest possible score. </p>

<p>If you are beginning to run out of time, you can take short cuts by jumping throught
the trap doors to the platform floating in the acid. This will cost you 100 points, but it
will save time. </p>

<p>When jumping over the pool of acid, watch closely for the spiders. They will give you
about a one-second warning before they drop into your path. It is best to make your jump
immediately after the spider has completed its descent. </p>

<p>Remember! This game gets more difficult with each stone you collect. Move as quickly as
possible to save the time you will need later when you face additional trapdoors, even
larger tarantulae, and movable platforms floating on the pool of acid. Be prepared for
even more surprises as you get closer to completing the barrier.</p>
