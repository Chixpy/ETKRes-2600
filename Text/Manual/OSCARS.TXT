of numerical skills and concepts as well as important prereading skills.
These include:
[Picture of 3 cups under a trash can with the number 3 on it]
1) Counting objects and matching the number of objects counted with its
corresponding numeral.
2) Recognizing the number of objects in a pattern.
[Picture of four arrows in circles pointing up, down, left and right]
3) Following directional arrows
4) Using the relational concepts up, down, left, and right.

When you play OSCAR'S TRASH RACE with your child you can reinforce numerical
concepts by talking about the game as you play.  Say the names of the numbers
out loud and encourage your child to say them too.

As you read this manual, from time to time you will see this symbol:
[Abstract drawing of a parent with arm around child]
The symbol will be followed by suggestions to help you and your child get the
most fun out of playing OSCAR'S TRASH RACE.

[Apple core] A Read-Aloud Story
[Drawing of a road, with 2 candy cane poles along the sign, with a banner in
between them saying "THE GROUCH DAY PICNIC".  A wooden sign points to the CITY
DUMP.  Trash lies along side the road.  A city skyline is in the distance.]

It was the morning of the annual Grouch Day Picnic.  The weather was perfect:
cloudy, cold, and dreary.  Little grouches from all over the country came to
the picnic, which was held at their favorite spot: the scenic city dump.  The
little grouches ate peanut butter and pickle sandwiches, showed off their junk
collections, told grumpy stories, and played grouch games.  But the high point
of the day was the Trash Race, a game invented by Oscar the Grouch and his pet
worm Slimey.

[Drawing of Oscar blowing his broken bugle, inside his trash can]
When Oscar blew his broken bugle, the race began.  The three grouchiest
grouches got to play first.  They lined up at the back of the dump and waited
for the start signal.  "Blaat!" went Oscar's trumpet.  "Here comes the trash
truck!" yelled the spectators in the grouch gallery.

[Drawing of dump truck dumping trash]
The three grouches waited nervously while a trash truck slowly backed into the
dump.  Out poured the trash: one, two, three, four - four old tin cans.  Each
grouch counted carefully and checked the number on his can to see if it
matched.  "It's Herman!" yelled someone in the crownd.  "No, I think it's
Grungetta!" yelled another.  But they were both wrong.  The Grouch with the
number four on her can was Sloppy.

"It's me!  It's me!" shouted Sloppy as she started racing to the trash.  She
knew she had to grab the trash and make it back to the starting line before
Slimey reached the other end of the dump.

[Picture of Oscar yelling at the trash race contestants.]
"Go Sloppy!" yelled the crowd.  "Go Slimey!" shouted Oscar the Grouch.  Sloppy
raced through the muddy junk yard leaping over puddles and potholes as fast as
her little green legs would go.  By the time she reached the trash pile,
Sloppy really lived up to her name: She was covered with mud from head to toe.
Sloppy quickly grabbed the trash and ran back toward the starting line.  It
was a close race!  Slimey was only a slither away.  But the thought of the
grand prize gave Sloppy an extra burst of energy and she slid across the
starting line before Slimey got to the far edge of the dump.

[Picture of Oscar giving Sloppy an icky sardine sundae.]
"Hurrah!" yelled all the grouches.  "Boo!" yelled Oscar.  Sloppy stepped up to
Oscar's can to receive her prize.  It was a delicious, icky sardine sundae.

That day the little grouches ran several more races.  They simply loved racing
for [cracked plate] cracked plates, [old shoe] old shoes, [apple core] apple
cores, [letters] junk mail, used [2 toothbrushes] toothbrushes, crumpled tin
[crumpled tin can] cans, and other wonderful junk. [Hat with bite out of it,
banana peel, patched beach ball, bent hangar, cracked teapot.]

Of course, some of the little grouches liked playing in the puddles that
covered the dump as much as getting the trash!

After the Trash Races, the grimy participants celebrated by eating more peanut
butter and pickle sandwiches and talking about especially rotten aspects of
the games.  At the end of the day, everyone agreed that a grouchy time was had
by all!

NOW PLAY OSCAR'S TRASH RACE...HERE'S HOW:

All the little grouches want to show Oscar how fast they can count and collect
trash.  You can help them.

OBJECT OF THE GAME:

Help the little grouches count the trash, run to it, load it up, and return to
the starting line as quickly as possible.  Each time you finish a race you get
one point.

GET READY TO PLAY:

Follow the directions in SETTING UP to plug in the KID'S CONTROLLER, to use
the keypad overlay, and to select a game level.

To select a little grouch, press one of the three grouch buttons on your kepad
overlay.
[3 pictures of the trash can overlay button]

If you pick a grouch whose number doesn't match the number of trash pieces, a
buzzer sounds.

To move the grouch down toward the trash, press the arrow that points down:
[Picture of down arrow overlay button]

To move the grouch to the left, press the arrow that points left:
[Picture of left arrow overlay button]

To move right, press the arrow that points right:
[Picture of right arrow overlay button]

To make the grouch jump, press the jump button on your overlay
[Picture of trash can with 2 red feet below, with lines indicating jumping]

To move the grouch back up to the starting line, press the arrow that points
up.
[Picture of up arrow overlay button]

GAME VARIATIONS

OSCAR'S TRASH RACE contains seven action-packed game levels.  Below are
detailed descriptions of each.  For quick reference see the GAME MATRIX on the
back cover.

GAME 1: ONE-PLAYER PRACTICE GAME
[Picture of yellow trash can with purple feet, with the number 1 in the upper
left hand corner]

The trash truck dumps out one to five pieces of trash, one piece at a time.
First count the trash as it drops.  Then look at the grouches.  The correct
number appears on one of the grouch cans.  Select that little grouch by
pressing the grouch button on your overlay which corresponds to the grouch's
position.  To help the grouch get to the trash as quickly as possible, press
the left, right, and down arrows.  Then move the grouch back up to the
starting line by pressing the up arrow.  (See Figure 4.)  The little grouch
runs as fast as his furry legs can go - what fun it is to load up on that
nice, yucky trash!  There are three races to a game.  You receive one point at
the lower left side of the screen each time you finish a race.  After three
races, Oscar the Grouch makes his magnificent appearance!

[Parent/child picture]
Young children may need help counting objects.  Encourage your child to point
to the screen and count each piece of trash out loud as it falls.

GAME 2: ONE-PLAYER BEGINNING GAME
[Picture of yellow trash can with red feet, the number 2 in the upper left
hand corner.]

Again, the dump truck throws out one to five pieces of trash, one piece at a
time.  But now all the cans of the little grouches are numbered, so you must
count the pieces of trash and decide which grouch has the same number on his
can.  Press the corresponding grouch can on your overlay to select that
grouch.  Then press the right, left, and down arrows to help the grouch get to
the precious trash as quickly as possible.  As soon as you've loaded up the
trash, press the arrow that points up to run back to the starting line.  You
receive one point each time you complete a race.  After three races, Oscar
appears and congratulates you in his own grouchy manner.

GAMES 3 AND 4: ONE- AND TWO-PLAYER JUMP GAMES
[Picture of yellow trash can with green feet, and a brown puddle.  The number
3 is in the upper left hand corner]
[Picture of yellow trash can with red feet, and a brown puddle.  The number 4
is in the upper left hand corner]

Now the truck dumps one to nine pieces of trash on the ground.  Select the
grouch whose number matches the number of pieces of trash, and press the
arrows on your overlay to make him run!  In game 3 there are three puddles on
the race course.  In game 4 the rececourse[!] is covered with many messy
puddles.  When the running grouch gets to a puddle, you should either press
the jump button on your keypad overlay to help him jump over or use the arrows
to walk around the puddle.  You get one point for every puddle you jump.
Also, the grouches get down to the trash and return to the starting line
faster when you make them jump over puddles.  Once a grouch's toes touch a
puddle, she or he can't resist playing in the muck, as shown in Figure 5.
Just watch those little feet get covered with mud!

[Picture shows yellow trash can with purple feet and the number 3 on it in 
a puddle]
Figure 5 - Grouch in a Puddle

After three races in Game 3 and five races in Game 4, Oscar the Grouch shows
his grouchy face.  In two-player games, the second player takes over the
controller to run races after the first player finishes.  The number at the
lower left side of the screen totals the first player's points and the number
at the lower right side totals the second player's points.

GAME 5: ONE- AND TWO-PLAYER TIMED RACES
[Picture shows a yellow trash can with blue feet, a brown puddle, an
inchworm, and the number 5 in the upper left hand corner]

Take the little grouches on as many races as you can before Slimey the Worm
reaches the other side of the dump.  See Slimey at the bottom of the screen?
(Figure 6.)  He slowly crawls from one end of the dump to the other end where
Oscar awaits news of the races.  When Slimey reaches Oscar, time is up, the
game ends, and Oscar appears.

[Screen shot shows game play.  Slimey the Worm is pointed out]
Figure 6 - Timed Game

The truck dumps all the trash out at once and there are lots of puddles.  Try
to make the grouches jump over or run around these mudholes.  If their toes
touch that gooshy mud, they will hop in and play.  You get one point for every
puddle you leap and one point for each race you complete.  In two-player
games, the second player runs as many races as possible after time is up for
the first player.

[Picture of parent/child symbol]
You may want to draw your child's attention to Slimey the Worm on the screen,
and explain that when Slimey reaches the far right edge of the screen, the
game ends.

GAMES 6 AND 7: ONE- and TWO-PLAYER RAINY DAY GAMES
[Picture shows yellow trash can with brown feet, a blue puddle, and an
inchworm.  The number 6 appears in the upper left hand corner.]
[Picture shows yellow trash can with green feet, a blue puddle, and an
inchworm.  The number 7 appears in the upper left hand corner.]

Pay close attention and help the runners leap over all the mucky puddles on
the racecourse.  Remember, whenever a grouch gets into a puddle, the race is
delayed while the little grouch plays.

During these races, the sky darkens and rain falls on the runners.  When it
rains, the puddles fill up with blue rain water.  If you jump over a puddle
when it is blue, you score two points.

There are one to nine pieces of trash which are dumped all at once.  Slimey
times the game.  In two-player games, each player runs as many races as
possible before time is up.

In Game 7 everything moves really fast because the little grouches have their
speed up from all the practice they've gotten.
