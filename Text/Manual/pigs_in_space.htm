----------
SETTING UP
----------
Be sure your controllers are firmly plugged into the jacks on your console.
For one-player games, plug your controller into the left controller jack. Hold
the controller with the red button to your upper left, toward the television
screen.

Press GAME SELECT to choose a one- or two-player game. A number at the top of
the screen indicates a one-player game; numbers at the top and bottom of the
screen indicate a two-player game.

Note: The number of players can be selected only when the &quot;title screen&quot; is
displayed. To return the title screen, you must either finish the current game
or turn the power switch off and then on again.

Press GAME RESET to stop a game and return to the game choice screen.

When your DIFFICULTY switch is in the B-position, you earn a bonus round every
10,000 points. You do not earn bonus points when your DIFFICULTY switch is in
the A-position.

---------
GAME PLAY
---------
PIGS IN SPACE is a tripigathlon of three thrilling outer space games:
Chickenvaders, Pastaroids, and Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. As the
commander of the starship Swinetrek, your mission is to score the highest
points possible, and complete as many rounds as you can.

Press GAME RESET to display the game choice screen (see figure).

To select a game, move the joystick right or left to one of the three MUPPET
faces displayed on the game choice screen. Each face represents a different
game (Link Hogthrob for Chickenvaders, First Mate Piggy for Pastaroids, and
Dr. Strangepork for Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids). Press the red
controller button when a face flashes to start the game.

Each time you successfully complete a round, the game choice screen appears,
and you can continue playing the same game or select a new one. If you
continue playing the same game, the new round will be more difficult; You
begin PIGS IN SPACE with five rounds, and can earn extra rounds every 10,000
points (see SETTING UP).

-------------
CHICKENVADERS
-------------
While on a routine exploration of the Planet Cluck, Captain Link Hogthrob is
suddenly attacked by a squawking squadron of space chickens! Their devastating
and incredibly messy weapon: eggs.

Fearless Captain Link counterattacks by lobbing link sausages at the chickens
before they drop eggs all over his nice clean uniform. Each hit scores points
and sends the hens flying into the bird dimension! Use the joystick to move
Captain Link left or right, press the red button to fire a link sausage.

Note: only one sausage can appear on the screen at a time.

Link must quickly divert all the chickens before they force him down into the
muck of Planet Cluck. At the same time, he must dodge their messy eggs. If an
egg hits Link, he will be transformed into a chicken - a fate worse than
bacon! Either of these tragedies ends the rounds.

Link's other challenge is to hit Gonzo, who commands the chicken invasion from
his swirling saucer at the top of the screen. A direct sausage strike on
Gonzo's saucer sends him flying into deep space and earns you bonus points.

<pre><font size="2">Note: Point values for each upper row decrease when a lower row is eliminated.

Hitting Gonzo's saucers: 300 points.

Eliminating all chickens: 1000 points.

----------
PASTAROIDS
----------
Yikes! That pighead Link has accidentally ejected Miss Piggy into a raging
pastaroid storm. Now the intrepid First Mate Piggy must fight her way through
a treacherous torrent of Italian food to return to the good ship Swinetrek. If
the Swinetrek leaves the screen before Miss Piggy boards it, one round is lost
and the ship circles back around for another try.

Use your joystick to guide Miss Piggy through the pastaroid storm; press the
red button to karate-chop meatballs for bonus points. But watch out! If Miss
Piggy collides with a meatball or a strand of spaghetti, she'll be knocked
back to where she started.

SCORING

Karate-chopping a meatball: 100 points.

Boarding the Swinetrek: 1000 points.

----------------------------------
ESCAPE FROM PLANET OF THE GONZOIDS 
----------------------------------
The Swinetrek is trapped in an abandoned pizza mine guarded by gonzoids - 
weird metallic robots created by the crazed Gonzo. The gonzoids stand on
ledges and toss pizzas across the mine tunnels. These tunnels and pizzas can
disable the Swinetrek on contact by gumming up its hyperspace drive.

Here's the good news. To help you get through the mine, Dr. Strangepork has
invented a quasi-wonderful weapon, the Boomeray(TM). The Boomeray is an
arching ray especially designed to disintegrate the hard-to-reach gonzoids.
Move the Swinetrek left or right and press the fire button to shoot Boomerays
in the same direction. Like a boomerang, the Boomeray shoots upward then
curves back down.

But now for the bad news: When incorrectly aimed, the Boomeray can boomerang
back and disable the Swinetrek, ending a round. You'll also lose a round if
the Swinetrek doesn't escape the pizza mine.

Note: Pressing the fire button to start game play automatically fires your
Boomeray, so be careful not to move the Swinetrek. You might destroy it before
you destroy the gonzoids.

SCORING

Every mile forward: 1 point.

Destroying a gonzoid: 100 points.

Escaping mine: 1000 points.</font></pre>
