STAR WARS: JEDI ARENA

by Parker Brothers
c 1983


Will you accept the challenge to become the JEDI MASTER?  Find out if
you, a JEDI KNIGHT, are worthy of such a title.  Meet your opponent in
the JEDI ARENA, where you're face-to-face in an electrifying laser
battle.  Use quick reflexes and a swift LIGHT SABER to score
once...twice...three times.  When you do, you are the JEDI MASTER.



OBJECT
------

To beat your opponent by winning three JEDI matches.



SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS*
-----------------------------

1. To select a game number (see Game Selection Box), press down on the  
   GAME SELECT switch.  The game number will appear at the top of the   
   screen.

2. Set the DIFFICULTY SWITCH.
   Position A: You have 3 lines of protection in your FORCE FIELD.
   Position B: You have 4 lines of protection in your FORCE FIELD.
   
   In both one- and two=player games, the red player uses the left      
   DIFFICULTY SWITCH and the blue player uses the right DIFFICULTY      
   SWITCH.

3. Press down the GAME RESET switch--and you're ready to start the      
   action.

*  If you're playing on a SEARS VIDEO ARCADE(TM) unit, you may find     
   that the difficulty switched are called SKILL SWITCHES (Novice and   
   EXPERT).  You have 4 lines of protection in your FORCE FIELD with    
   the NOVICE SKILL SWITCH; you have 3 lines of protection in your      
   FORCE FIELD with the EXPERT SKILL SWITCH.



THE PADDLE CONTROLLERS
----------------------

Make sure you plug the paddle controllers firmly into the LEFT
controller jack at the back of your video system.  Use the paddle for
both offensive and defensive strategy.  Go on the offense and shoot
laser bolts at your opponent by pressing the FIRE button.  Defend
yourself from your opponent's laser bolts by turning the paddle dial. 
Your LIGHTSABER will move left and right to block the bolts.

In a one-player game, use the paddle that controls the blue JEDI
KNIGHT.

The computer is the red JEDI KNIGHT.



PLAYING
-------

This illustration shows a view from the top of the JEDI ARENA, looking
down.  Both JEDI KNIGHTS (red and blue) are in position behind their
FORCE FIELDS (with DIFFICULTY SWITCH set at Position B).  The SEEKER is
motionless, until the players are ready to begin.

[Image of the screen.  The Game Number/Game Level is at the upper left
hand corner.  The Red JEDI KNIGHT is at the top of the screen.  The
Protective FORCE FIELD is surrounding the Red JEDI KNIGHT.  The Red
JEDI KNIGHT LIGHTSABER is the red sword coming from the Red Jedi
Knight.  The SEEKER is ball that floats around in the center of the
screen and fires lasers at the JEDI KNIGHTS.  The Blue JEDI KNIGHT is
at the bottom of the screen.  He also has a Protective FORCE FIELD and
he uses the Blue JEDI KNIGHT LIGHTSABER.]



RED JEDI KNIGHT VS. BLUE JEDI KNIGHT
------------------------------------

In a one-player game, the computer is the red JEDI KNIGHT and you're
the blue.  In a two-player game, one player controls the red JEDI
KNIGHT and the other player controls the blue JEDI KNIGHT.

As the SEEKER whirls around the arena, use both offensive and defensive
strategy to score points.



OFFENSIVE STRATEGY:
-------------------

THE SEEKER AND THE LIGHTSABER

Both you and your opponent use the SEEKER as a weapon.  When you press
the FIRE button, a laser bolt (red or blue, depending on your KNIGHT's
color) will shoot our from the SEEKER at your opponent.  You control
the angle of the laser bolt with your LIGHTSABER by turning the paddle
dial in the direction you wish the laser bolt to fire.  But be quick,
because the SEEKER is constantly moving.  Watch the position of the
SEEKER, aim your LIGHTSABER, then fire!  

Direct a laser bolt at your opponent's FORCE FIELD.  Every time you hit
a protective line of the FIELD, you'll hear a sound that means you've
knocked away a piece of the FIELD.  Send a bolt through an opening in
the FIELD, and you score!

You can use your opponent's laser bolts to your advantage.  Whenever a
bolt hits your LIGHTSABER, the bolt is "frozen" to that spot for a
brief moment.  Take advantage of such a moment to quickly aim a bolt at
your opponent.



DEFENSIVE STRATEGY:
-------------------

THE FORCE FIELD AND THE LIGHTSABER

The FORCE FIELD protects you as long as it's there.  Whenever a laser
bolt hits any protective line of your FIELD, a piece of that line is
knocked away.  Once all the protective lines in a section have been
knocked away, your opponent can score by sending a laser bolt through
the opening.

Use your LIGHTSABER to block laser bolts directed at your FORCE FIELD.



HE ULTIMATE CHALLENGES:
------------------------

THE "WILD" SEEKER AND THE INVISIBLE SEEKER

As you play, the energy in the SEEKER builds and builds and builds...
until it reaches the highest level.  When this happens, the SEEKER goes
wild!  It'll zoom around the arena, rapidly shooting multi-colored
laser bolts at both JEDI KNIGHTS.  There is no offensive play (firing)
at this time, only defense (moving LIGHTSABERS for protection).  If the
SEEKER sends a bolt through a KNIGHT'S FORCE FIELD, the other KNIGHT
scores a point.

Game Number 7 and 8 have the invisible SEEKER.  You won't know where
the SEEKER is until you fire a laser bolt.  But then your opponent will
also know where it is, too.  The invisible SEEKER also becomes a "wild"
SEEKER--the ultimate challenge of the skill of the JEDI KNIGHTS.



END OF GAME
-----------

Each time a laser bolt gets through your opponent's FORCE FIELD, you
score a point and end that match.  The action of the game will stop
briefly, then resume with the JEDI KNIGHTS facing each other from a
different side.  Players begin again with a new FORCE FIELD in front of
them.

The game ends when one JEDI KNIGHT has scored three points (won three
matches).  At that time, the action will stop and the STAR WARS theme
will play.

To Play Again: Press the GAME RESET button to play again at the same
game number.  To play at another game number, use the GAME SELECT
switch, then press GAME RESET.



SCORING
-------

The score is displayed at the top of the screen throughout the game. 
You score a point every time a laser bolt gets through your opponent's
FORCE FIELD:
