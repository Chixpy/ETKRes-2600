Gun Position 

Your Joystick Controller changes the angle of your "Anti-Aircraft Gun" and also the angle of the missile flight in
Guided Missile Games. Forward = 30 degree; center or rest = 60 degrees; back = 90 degrees (straight up). 

In the Anti-Aircraft games, from one to six flying objects will move together across the playfield in a set. All
objects in the set must be hit before a new set will appear. Each object scores one point. 

GAME 1
This is the Anti-Aircraft game described above. Your missile travels at the same angle your "Anti-Aircraft gun"
was in at the time you fire. 

GAME 2
In this game, you and your opponent have "guided" missiles. After firing, you control the angle of flight of your
missile by moving your Joystick Controller from front to back. 

GAME 3
The left "gun" is fired continuously by the computer. Using the right Joystick Controller, try to out score the
computer.

playfield travelling at different speeds and directions. Each object has a different score value; Small Jet = 4
points; Large Jet = 3 points; Helicopter = 2 points; 747 = 1 points. The "Observation Blimps" flying randomly
across the bottom of the playfield score no points, and act as an obstruction to your line of fire. 

GAME 4
In this game your missile travels at the same angle as your "gun" was in at the time you fired. 

GAME 5
Using "guided" missiles try to outscore your opponent. After firing, you control the angle of flight of your missile
by moving your Joystick Controller from front to back. 

GAME 6
Here's another chance to beat the computer. The right Joystick Controller is your "gun", while the computer
fires the left "gun" continuously.
