COCONUTS

[Screen shot of game with Stanley holding umbrella and Coco hurling one 
nut down at him]

BOMBS AWAY!
Coco the crazy monkey is on the loose again, hurling coconuts down on our 
intrepid jungle explorer, Stanley I. Presume.

Your job?  Help Stanley avoid those falling coconuts.  But be prepared.  
The better you do, the crazier Coco gets, and the faster the coconuts fly.

OBJECT OF THE GAME
Make Coco go Nuts!  And get the highest possible score before Coco knocks 
you out.

GETTING READY TO PLAY
Play with one or two players using the Joystick Controllers.  Always be 
sure the power is off before inserting or removing the CocoNuts cartridge 
from your video game system.  Use the controller plugged into the LEFT 
CONTROLLER jack for one player games.  Hold the controller so the red 
button is to your upper left. 

DIFFICULTY SWITCH
With the difficulty switch in the "B" position, Stanley moves quickly, 
making it much easier to dodge coconuts-and drive Coco nuts!  The "A" 
position slows Stanley down, making your job much more difficult.

TO BEGIN PLAY
Press game reset. (For two-person game press game select button and then 
reset.)  Push red button when you're ready to be bombarded.  Move the 
joystick controller from side to side to make sure Stanley doesn't get hit.

HOW THE GAME PROGRESSES
Stanley starts out well-equpped, with both an umbrella and a pith 
helmet.  Hit number one-he loses the umbrella, Hit number two-bye bye helmet.

But all is not lost!  Upon reaching 500 points-and again at 1500 
points-you earn back the last piece of equipment Stanley lost.  The game 
is over when Stanley takes a git directly on the head.

You'll notice that even crazy monkeys have to rest!  So the coconuts come 
in a series and then stop.  (You might want to catch your breath too!)  
To continue play just press the red button.  That makes Coco madder and 
madder.  And he starts throwing faster and faster.

SCORING
You earn points every time Coco misses.  The faster the coconuts fly, the 
higher your score.

Series		Points per coconut
===================================
1 and 2			 5 pts
3 and 4			10 pts
5 and 6			15 pts
7 to end		20 pts

TWO PLAYER GAME
(For two-person game press game select button and then reset.)  Players 
alternate each time Stanley gets hit by a coconut.  Stanley changes color 
and the next player pushes the red button on the joystick controller to 
start his turn.  Scores are color-coded, corresponding to player colors.

Play continues until both players are knocked out.
