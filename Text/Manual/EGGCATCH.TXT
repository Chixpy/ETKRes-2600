* Note to Parents

BIG BIRD'S EGG CATCH provides children with a fun way to practice skills
important in beginning reading and problem solving.

1) Following eggs that move down chutes requires a child to carefully
   focus his/her visual attention.

2) In order to anticipate the egg's path, a child must distinguish that
   path from distracting elements.

3) Learning to use directional arrows on the controller to move Big Bird
   back and forth provides experience with print symbols that a young 
   child will need to use in school.

4) Using the arrows also gives children practice with hand-eye coordination
   and the relational concepts of left and right.

When you play BIG BIRD'S EGG CATCH with your child, you can reinforce these
learning goals by talking about the game as you play.  Say things like,
"Where do you think the egg is going to come out now?" and, "Can you make
Big Bird move to the left (or right)?"  Also encourage your child to talk
about the game.


* Setting Up

HOW TO USE YOUR ATARI KID'S CONTROLLER

Use your ATARI KID'S CONTROLLER to play BIG BIRD'S EGG CATCH

Plug the ATARI KID'S CONTROLLER into the LEFT controller jack at the back
of your ATARI 2600 console. (See Figure 1.) In two-player games, players 
take turns using the controller as each person's turn comes up.

           [Figure 1 - Plugging in the Controller]

You will find one keypad overlay included with this cartridge.  This
colorful overlay will help your child select and use appropriate buttons.
Slip the overlay tabs into the slots at the top and bottom of your ATARI
KID'S CONTROLLER, as shown in Figure 2.

                [Figure 2 - Keypad Overlay]

             --------------------------------------------
               Note: The "Atari Kid's Controller" was a
               large  6" x 7 1/2" Video Touch Pad that
               was bought separately from the game cart.
               The Video Touch Pad that came with the
               game "Star Raiders" could even be used in
               it's place.  The Big Bird overlay for the 
               controller blocked off all but two keys:

            (move left) <-- 5 key     6 key --> (move right)

* A Read-Aloud Story

FARMER BIG BIRD'S EGG CATCH

The sun rose on Big Bird's farm.  "Cock-a-doodle-day!" crowed the rooster.
"Time to get up!"

Farmer Big Bird jumped out of his nest and ran to the chicken coop to check
on his four favorite hens.

"Good morning dear chickens!" called Big Bird, throwing open the henhouse
door.

But the four hens were fast asleep.

"Wake up! Wake up!" cried Big Bird.  "Today is our big day!  Today we enter
the egg-laying contest at the county fair.  The hens who lay the most eggs
will win a big prize."

But the four tired hens just ruffled their feathers and snuggled deeper
into their nests.

"But you must get up!" cried Big Bird.  "this is the day we've been training
for!"

Henrietta Hen opened one sleepy red eye and peeked up at Farmer Big Bird.
"That's just it, Big Bird," she said.  "We've been practicing our egg-
laying so much that we're all tuckered out.  We hardly have enough energy
left to cluck.  We certainly can't lay any more eggs."

"Oh dear, what shall I do?" wondered Big Bird as he slowly walked fron the
henhouse to his own nest to get some breakfast.  "How can I put the cluck
back into my chickens?"

Big Bird sighed as he slumped into his nest and started to munch his 
favorite morning meal.  He absent-mindedly picked up the bird seed box
and began to read the label: "BIRD SEED - Breakfast of Wonder Wings!
Helps Build Better Beaks 12 Ways!"

"That's it!" shouted Big Bird.  "Now I know what to do!"

Grabbing the box of bird seed, Big Bird ran to the henhouse.  "Here my
sleepy little friends," he called.  "Eat some breakfast and don't worry
about the contest."

As the chickens ate the delicious crunchy bird seed, they began to cluck 
and fluff up their feathers and flap their wings.

"Big Bird, what time is the county fair egg-laying contest?" asked Emily
Hen.

"Yeah.  Let's get going!  We don't want to be late!" said Gertrude Chicken.

"Wow! I feel like I could lay a dozen eggs in three minutes!" clucked
Henrietta Hen.

"And I think I'm going to lay a GOLDEN EGG!" screeched Brenda the Banty Hen.

And off they went to the county fair contest.

At the end of the day when all the eggs were counted, the judge slowly
walked up to the platform to announce the winner.  Big Bird's heart was
beating so hard he was sure everyone could see it pounding in his chest.
He knew his hens had done their best, but was their best good enough to 
win the prize?

"The winner of the GOLDEN EGG award is..." the judge paused to clear his
throat and Big Bird covered his eyes with his wings.  "Big Bird!" shouted
the judge, "and his four fabulous fowls!"

Everyone cheered as Big Bird and his happy hens held up their beautiful
prize for all to see.


* Game Play

NOW PLAY BIG BIRD'S EGG CATCH...HERE'S HOW:

Big Bird wants to win the county fair egg contest.  You can help him. 

OBJECT OF THE GAME:

Help Big Bird collect eggs by catching them as soon as they fall from the
chutes.

GET READY TO PLAY:

Follow the directions in SETTING UP to plug in the KID'S CONTROLLER, to
use the keypad overlay, and to select a game level.

To move right or left under the egg chutes, press the arrow on your key-
pad overlay that points in the direction you want to go.  You must be
standing under a chute to catch the egg as soon as it comes out. 
(See Figure 4.)

                   [Figure 4 - Catching an Egg]

GAME VARIATIONS

BIG BIRD'S EGG CATCH offers ten exciting levels of game play.  Below are
detailed descriptions of each game.  For quick reference see the GAME
MATRIX on the back cover.

GAME 1: ONE-PLAYER PRACTICE GAME

Help Big Bird catch as many eggs as he can by moving him back and forth
beneath two straight, widely spaced egg chutes.  Each time you press an
arrow to move Big Bird, he will zoom directly under a chute.  After the
chickens have laid some eggs, they rest, and you get to see how many eggs
you collected during that egg-laying round.  Figure 5 shows you where to
look for your score.

   [Figure 5 - Practice Game Score Display] (Score shown in lower left)  

In the practice game, children may need some help getting started.  Ask
your child, "Which way does Big Bird need to go to catch the egg?  Show
me with your finger."

GAMES 2 AND 3: ONE- AND TWO-PLAYER BEGINNING GAMES

Help Big Bird catch as many eggs as he can.  At first the hens lay slowly,
but as the super delicious bird seed takes effect, the hens lay faster and
the eggs come down the chutes with greater speed!  After the chickens lay
some eggs, they rest.  Then your score for that round is shown on the
screen (see Figure 6), and the other player goes egg-catching.  In Game 2,
the eggs roll down through three and four straight chutes, while in Game 3,
they roll down through three and four zigzag chutes

                  [Figure 6 - Two-Player Game Scores] 
              (Player 1's Score - bottom left on screen)
              (Player 2's Score - bottom right on screen)

GAME'S 4, 5, AND 6: ONE- AND TWO-PLAYER 
GOLDEN EGG CATCH

Now you must carefully center Big Bird under the chutes, because he no longer
zooms under the next chute when you press the arrow on your keypad overlay.
In these games, you go on three egg-collecting rounds, and your score is 
automatically added up so you get one score from all three rounds.  There
are twelve eggs to a dozen and the hens lay a dozen eggs each round, then
they rest, and a new chute appears.

Children may need some help learning how to center Big Bird under the
chutes.  If your child has difficulty say, "Look carefully.  Is Big Bird
under the chute?"

Watch for the golden eggs worth five points each!  One golden egg and 11
plain white eggs are laid during each round.  When you catch a golden egg
you'll hear a special tune that congratulates you on your great catch!

You may want to draw your child's attention to the EGGS sign on the roof
of the barn, and explain that when a golden egg is laid, the sign, which
is normally white, will turn yellow. (See figure 7)

                    [Figure 7 - Golden Egg Clue]

In Game 4 you start out with two zigzagging chutes and end up with four;
in Game 5 you start out with two crisscrossing chutes and end up with
with four; and in game 6 you get four crisscrossing chutes in each round.
You'll really have Big Bird running because in the second and third rounds
of each game, the eggs come out faster than in the previous round.  In
two-player games, you take turns after each round of a dozen eggs are laid.
See if you can make a perfect score of 48 points!

GAME 7: ONE AND TWO-PLAYER EGG MISS

Here's your chance to catch eggs forever!  You begin this game with five
broken eggs displayed on the screen next to your score. (See Figure 8.)
Each time you miss an egg, one of these broken eggs disappers, telling
you how many eggs you can miss before ending the game.  Here's the best
part: The chickens lay one golden egg in each round, and if you catch it, 
you get five points plus an extra chance to miss an egg!  This means you
can keep playing as long as you see at least one broken egg next to your
score.
The screen will show up to ten broken eggs at one time; additional eggs
not shown on the screen are held in reserve.  The eggs roll down through 
four crisscrossing chutes.  The longer you play, the faster those little
hens lay, so be ready for an exciting race!  In two-player games, players
take turns after each round of a dozen eggs.

                     [Figure 8 - Egg Miss Game]
              (Eggs Remaining shown at left of score)

Game 8: ONE- AND TWO-PLAYER INVISIBLE EGG CATCH

Here's a new twist on a rolling egg: It's invisible until it falls out of 
the chute!  That's the way the eggs roll in this game.  You can't see them
coming down the chutes; you can only see them as they fall out of the chutes.
Watch the chickens.  Each time one is ready to lay an egg, she stands up.
Press the arrow on your keypad overlay to center Big Bird under the chute
of the chicken who just laid the egg.  It won't be easy, since the five
chutes crisscross and the hens lay faster with each round.  Also, as in
Game 7, you end the game if you miss all the eggs displayed next to your
score.  Try to catch each golden egg for five extra points and an extra
chance to miss an egg.  In two-player games, players take turns after each
round of twelve eggs.

GAMES 9 AND 10: ONE- AND TWO-PLAYER
SHRINKING CHUTES

Here's your chance to put all your practice skill, and concentration to
work.  In these games the chutes shrink before your eyes! (See Figure 9.)
These are four crisscrossing chutes that gradually disappear in the
direction of the hen's nests.  This means you must memorize the pattern
of the chutes in order to know which one the egg will drop from.  In
Game 9, the chute pattern remains the same throughout each round.  But,
in Game 10 the chute pattern changes just before each egg is laid!  What
a challenge!

The hens lay one golden egg and eleven plain eggs per round.  You start
the game with five eggs to miss.  You gain five points and an extra egg-
missing chance each time you catch a golden egg.  Also, the longer you
play, the faster the eggs come!  In two-player games, Players take turns 
after each round.

                 [Figure 9 - Shrinking Chutes Game]
