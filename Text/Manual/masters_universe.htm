Guide HE-MAN through the dangers of ETERNIA, It's 28 long and torturous miles from the
workshop of MAN-AT-ARMS' to CASTLE GRAYSKULL. The EVIL WARRIORS' are waiting for you along
the way with ENERGY BOLTS and WARP TRAKKERS. If you make it to CASTLE GRAYSKULL, SKELETOR

<br>
The object of the game is to score as many points as possible while guiding HE-MAN in
battle against his evil foes. During the first half of the game, HE-MAN is at the controls
of his trusty WIND RAIDER. He must fly the 30 miles from the workshop of MAN-AT-ARMS to
CASTLE GRAYSKULL. Nearly every mile of this terrain could end the quest of HE-MAN. EVIL
WARRIORS hurl deadly WARP TRAKKERS and ENERGY BOLTS at HE-MAN as he flies overhead. He
defends himself with the ION CANNON, MUTRON BOMBS, and fearless flying maneuvers. With
enough skill and luck, you can fly HE-MAN to CASTLE GRAYSKULL, but that's only half the
battle.<br>
<br>
Once you land the WIND RAIDER on CASTLE GRAYSKULL, you are magically projected inside a
dungeon room to battle SKELETOR. The room has two moving walls. Each wall has three gaps.
The walls are always in motion and the gaps are never still. HE-MAN uses the gaps to reach
SKELETOR. SKELETOR Is moving and firing LASER BLASTS at HE-MAN while he tries to pass
through the gaps. HE-MAN defends himself from the LASER BLAST with his POWER SWORD. If
HE-MAN touches SKELETOR, the victory screen plays and you can move on to the next level<br>
<br>
Use your LEFT joystick controller to control the direction of your WIND RAIDER or HE-MAN.
Be sure your controller cable is securely plugged into the back of your game console. Hold
the controller so the red FIRE BUTTON is to your UPPER LEFT.<br>
<br>
- Push joystick LEFT to move WIND RAIDER or HE-MAN LEFT.<br>
- Push joystick RIGHT to move WIND RAIDER or HE-MAN RIGHT.<br>
<br>
- Push joystick FORWARD to move WIND RAIDER or HE-MAN UP.<br>
<br>
- Pull joystick BACK to move WIND RAIDER or HE-MAN DOWN.<br>
<br>
LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY IS ONLY CONTROLLED BY THE LEFT DIFFICULTY SWITCH,<br>
<br>
The A position starts the game at level 1 (for beginners). The<br>
B position starts the game at level 3. (Level 2 can be reached<br>
only by completing level 1 .)<br>
<br>
The right difficulty switch freezes the action. In position A, the game plays normally. In
position B, the action freezes. Start the game in position A. This switch can be used to
show a friend a particular screen or for a rest period<br>
<br>
The TV TYPE switch determines whether the ION CANNON will be single or rapid fire. For
single fire, select B&amp;W. For rapid fire, select COLOR.<br>
<br>
To start the game, turn the power on. The title screen shows PRINCE ADAM magically
transforming into HE-MAN. The game begins with HE-MAN in his WIND RAIDER. To start the
game sooner, press the fire button. To restart the game at the end of a game, press RESET.
The game starts as soon as you move the WIND RAIDER.<br>
<br>
THE QUEST FOR CASTLE GRAYSKULL<br>
<br>
There are two halves to the MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE game. The first half is The Quest for
CASTLE GRAYSKULL. You control HE-MAN in his WIND RAIDER. Your goal is to fly the 30
treacherous miles from the workshop of MAN-AT-ARMS to CASTLE GRAYSKULL. You may choose
either direction to fly in, but it is best to keep going m the same direction once you've
started.<br>
<br>
<strong>EVIL WARRIORS</strong><br>
The EVIL WARRIORS are sent by SKELETOR to threaten HE-MAN on nearly every mile of his
journey. Each EVIL WARRIOR, including one who is invisible, is equipped with two types of
weapons ENERGY BOLTS and WARP TRAKKERS.<br>
<br>
<strong>ENERGY BOLTS and WARP TRAKKERS</strong><br>
ENERGY BOLTS are hurled by the EVIL WARRIORS. They travel straight UP, If they hit you,
you lose one WIND RAIDER. But if you dodge them, they don't follow you. WARP TRAKKERS are
also hurled by the EVIL WARRIORS. They home in on your WIND RAIDER wherever you move it.
If they hit you, you lose one WIND RAIDER.<br>
<br>
<strong>WIND RAIDER</strong><br>
HE-MAN starts with three WIND RAIDERS to help him get to CASTLE GRAYSKULL, HE-MAN can
replace destroyed WIND RAIDERS if he can make it back to the workshop of MAN-AT-ARMS with
at least one WIND RAIDER intact and enough energy units to get a new one. He simply lands
the last WIND RAIDER on the workshop and he is able to exchange energy units for more
ships. The Ships cost 100 x (current playing level) energy units apiece. You may never
have more than three ships. If you lose all your ships, the game is over.<br>
<br>
<strong>ION CANNON</strong><br>
The ION CANNON is the only defense against the WARP TRAKKER. Line up your WIND RAIDER in
front of the WARP TRACKER and press the fire button. If you hit the WARP TRAKKER, it
explodes and you score energy units. (Consult Scoring Chart.) Any ENERGY BOLTS onscreen at
the time are also destroyed by the blast.<br>
<br>
The ION CANNON can be used for single or rapid fire. In rapid fire, the ION CANNON has
half the range it has in single fire. For single fire, select B&amp;W using the TV TYPE
switch. For rapid fire, select COLOR using the TV TYPE switch.<br>
<br>
Anytime a WARP TRAKKER is onscreen, the red fire button<br>
activates the ION CANNON. Otherwise, it drops MUTRON BOMBS.<br>
<br>
<strong>MUTRON BOMBS</strong><br>
The moment after you hit a WARP TRAKKER and it explodes, your fire button drops MUTRON
BOMBS. If a MUTRON BOMB strikes an ENERGY BOLT, they both explode and you get some energy
units (Consult Scoring Chart). If the BOMBS strike the ground, they create craters that
the EVIL WARRIORS are swept into. But stay alert!The moment an EVIL WARRIOR is able to
hurt another WARP TRAKKER, the ION CANNON is again activated The active weapon is
indicated by the color of the border. Green means you control MUTRON BOMBS.<br>
<br>
<strong>CASTLE GRAYSKULL</strong> <br>
Once you arrive at CASTLE GRAYSKULL, you have completed the first half of your mission.
The mystical qualities of CASTLE GRAYSKULL freeze WARP TRAKKERS and drive off the EVIL
WARRIORS. Land your WIND RAIDER on the CASTLE and watch all your WIND RAIDERS
automatically be exchanged for energy units, Then, brace yourself to be projected into a
dungeon room to battle SKELETOR.<br>
<br>
<strong>THE BATTLE WITH SKELETOR</strong><br>
In the second half of this game, you must battle SKELETOR inside CASTLE GRAYSKULL. Once
you land the WIND RAIDER on top of CASTLE GRAYSKULL, HE-MAN is automatically projected
inside a ROOM WITH ROLLING WALLS.<br>
<br>
<strong>ROLLING WALLS</strong><br>
The ROLLING WALLS move back and forth from left to right. There are three gaps in each
wall. HE-MAN must use the gaps to run from the left side of the room to SKELETOR on the
right side of the room without touching the walls. Use the joystick to guide HE*MAN. If he
touches a wall, he is instantly propelled back to the left side of the room and must start
over. He also loses energy units and slows down for a few seconds until the border of the
room stops flickering. The longer he takes to get to SKELETOR, the more energy units he
loses and the faster the walls move.<br>
<br>
<strong>LASER BLASTS</strong><br>
But that's not all HE-MAN must worry about. He also must dodge or block all the LASER
BLASTS that SKELETOR shoots at him from across the room. HE-MAN can block the blasts by
raising his POWER SWORD in front of him. Use the fire button to do this at just the right
moment. HE-MAN gets energy units for blocking a blast. If he gets hit, HE-MAN is propelled
back to the left side of the room. He also loses energy units and speed until the room
stops flickering.<br>
<br>
When HE-MAN reaches the opposite side of the room, move him up or down to touch SKELETOR.
BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL, HE-MAN defeats SKELETOR. A victory screen shows and the HE-MAN
theme plays. When it is over, the game automatically starts at the next level. To start
the next level sooner, press the fire button.<br>

*MULTIPLY THE NUMBER OF ENERGY UNITS BY THE LEVEL YOU ARE ON<br>
<br>
<strong>MAXIMUM SCORE</strong><br>
The maximum score onscreen is 999,900. After this, the score wraps around to 0, but the
level and al other aspects of the scoring remain the same.<br>
<br>
A peak score is saved from the first time the game s powered up. This score is displayed
when the game is over, alternating with the current score. The peak score flashes on and
off while it's displayed. The solid score is the current score, If the game ends in the
ROOM WITH ROLLING WALLS, the non-zero score is the peak score.<br>
<br>
<strong>PLAYING LEVELS</strong><br>
There are B levels in this game. After level 8, you can keep playing, but the level of
difficulty does not increase. As you play, the movements of the WARP TRAKKERS and SKELETOR
become more jerky and less predictable. Everything speeds up and BOLTS, BLASTS, and
TRAKKERS are fired more often.<br>
<br>
The WARP TRAKKERS home in on the WIND RAIDER above the level of the ION CANNON. So don't
hover at the top of the screen.<br>
<br>
Drop bombs as often as possible. This way you can sweep as many EVIL WARRIORS as possible
off the screen, as well as keep them from throwing WARP TRAKKERS.<br>
<br>
If an EVIL WARRIOR is swept off the screen while a WARP TRAKKER is present, no new EVIL
WARRIOR appears until HE-MAN destroys the WARP TRAKKER or it destroys his WIND RAIDER.<br>
<br>
Stay off the bottom of the screen. The EVIL WARRIORS can and will fire when you're
directly above them.<br>
