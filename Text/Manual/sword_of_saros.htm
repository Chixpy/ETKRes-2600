<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>How to Use the<br>
Starpath SuperCharger</strong><br>
<br>
- Set up your Atari Video Computer System (or any similar game system that takes Video
Computer System game cartridges) according to manufacturer instructions. Use joystick
controller..<br>
- Make sure power switch is OFF, and insert the Starpath Supercharger with label up. Be
careful not to force it or to insert if crookedly.<br>
- Connect the plug on the end of the Supercharger cable to the earphone jack of any
cassette recorder/player.* (This jack may also be labeled &quot;monitor,&quot;
&quot;mon.,&quot; &quot;ear,&quot; or &quot;output.&quot;)<br>
<br>
- For best results, keep the cassette player at least a few inches away from the TV set.<br>
<br>
- Turn the power switch of the game ON. The TV screen should read &quot;REWIND TAPE, PRESS
PLAY.&quot; If not, turn the power off and check to be sure the system is properly hooked
up and the Supercharger is fully inserted.<br>
<br>
- Insert Side A of your game. Side A of the cassette is the quick load side;<br>
<br>
Side B is the Standard load side. Some cassette players may not load reliably on the quick
load side. If so, flip the tape over and use Side B.<br>
- Set volume and tone controls near high or maximum.<br>
- Press REWIND and wait until the tape stops moving. Now press PLAY.<br>
- In a few moments, you will hear the sounds of the game loading and see colored panels
fill the<br>
screen. A moment later &quot;STOP TAPE&quot; will appear, and you'll be ready to play your
game.<br>
<br>
If you have trouble...<br>
- If the tape player makes a screeching noise, you have not plugged the Supercharger cable
into the earphone jack.<br>
- If the tape doesn't move, check the batteries in the cassette player.<br>
<br>
- Rewind the tape completely and try again.<br>
- Try Side B of the game cassette if Side A won't load properly. Set volume and tone
controls at high or maximum.<br>
- Move the cassette player farther from the TV set and try again.<br>
<br>
* If you use a large cassette deck with a &quot;phone&quot; type earphone plug, you may
purchase an adapter at most electronics specialty stores.<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>The Object</strong>: Find your way out of the dungeon of the evil wizard as you
discover pieces of the magical Sword of Saros.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Situation</strong>: You are an adventurer, and your quest for the Sword of
Saros has brought you to the maze-like dungeons of an evil wizard. The wizard knows you
are there, and he and his giant tracker bat pursue you relentlessly. If the wizard catches
you, he will send deadly skeletons to attack you.<br>
There are seven levels to the dungeon, and on each level there are eight rooms. The rooms
contain treasures which are guarded by evil monsters. Some of the treasures are magical
items that you can use. Much of the treasure is gold with which you can bribe the monsters
on the final level.<br>
In one of the rooms on each level you will find doors to which you need keys to pass
through. Behind one door is a piece of the sword you need, and it will magically teleport
you to the next level. Treasures lie behind the other doors.<br>
On the final level of the dungeon, the rooms contain only open doors. One of these doors
will provide your escape--all you have to do is find the right door. The monsters there
will leave you alone as long as you have at least 100 gold pieces, and they will take that
amount from you as payment for each door tried.<br>
When your adventure is over, you will be given a ranking. The highest ranking is WIZARD.<br>
<br>
<strong>Life Points</strong><br>
<br>
You begin your adventure with 25 life points. Getting hit by monsters reduces life points
and, if they reach zero, you lose your life. While in the maze, you will see a flashing
green warning when your life points go below 10. Watch your life points carefully!<br>
<br>
<strong>The Maze</strong><br>
<br>
As you move, you leave an invisible trail for some distance behind you. The wizard and his
tracker bat wander through the maze searching for you. If the wizard stumbles across your
path, he will follow you from there on. If the bat crosses your path, the wizard will
teleport to the point where the bat found you and will follow you from there on.<br>
On the first two levels of the dungeon, you will automatically see the entire maze on the
screen. On the third and fourth levels, the wizard's magic is stronger and the maze will
only be revealed to you as you explore it. On the later levels, the wizard's magic is
stronger still, and you will only see the small area immediately surrounding you. Of
course, there is magic you can use to temporarily overcome these later handicaps.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Magic Menu</strong><br>
<br>
To see the magic menu while you are in the maze, hit the joystick button. Your life points
and the amount of gold you have collected are displayed at the top of the screen. Below
that you will see a list of all the items you possess.<br>
<br>
<br>
You begin the game with one of each magical item. The items you find in the rooms are
added to your collection. You cannot have more than 9 of any item.<br>
To use an item, select it with the joystick and press the button. If you do not wish to
use any item, select --RETURN--. An item vanishes when it is used. Most have a duration of
about 10 seconds. Magic is not cumulative, and using an item while another is still in
effect cancels the previous magic. Here is a list of the magical items and their uses.<br>
<br>
<strong>Gold</strong>: Cannot be selected. It is automatically used on the final dungeon
level to bribe monsters to leave you alone as you try doors.<br>
<strong>Gems</strong>: After you have collected 9 gems, using them provides you one or
more of each other type of item.<br>
<strong>Lamp</strong>: Makes the entire maze visible.<br>
<strong>Potion</strong>: Causes you to recover from 4-7 life points. Your life points can
never be greater than 25.<br>
<strong>Cross</strong>: Causes the wizard and the bat to move as far away from you as they
possibly can.<br>
<strong>Scroll</strong>: Allows you to see the wizard and bat even when they are not in
the visible portion of the maze.<br>
<strong>Ring</strong>: Causes you to be invisible to the wizard, the bat, and the monsters
in the rooms.<br>
<strong>Key</strong>: Cannot be selected. A key is used each time you pass through a door,
except on the last level. You will lose all your extra keys each time you go to a new
level.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Rooms</strong><br>
<br>
When you enter a room, the room Will be displayed on the screen. There are niches at the
top and bottom of the room.<br>
To get an item or to try a door, move in front of the niche containing it and remain there
a short time. You cannot pick up an item if you already have nine of that particular type,
and you cannot pass through a closed door. If a door is closed, it means you do not have a
key and must go find one.<br>
If a monster touches you, you will take 1 to 5 life points of damage. Be careful--the
monsters get quicker as the game progresses.<br>
Exits from rooms are in the corners but they are hidden. To leave a room, you must try to
guess where the exit is and move through the wall.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Wizard Encounter</strong><br>
<br>
When you encounter the wizard, you will be hit instantly for 1 to 5 life points. The
wizard will stand at the top of the screen and you will begin at the bottom. The wizard
will send waves of skeletons to attack you. You must maneuver through the skeletons and
reach the top. If the skeletons touch you, you will take 1 to 4 points of damage. When you
reach the wizard, he will teleport to where the giant bat lies, and begin searching for
you again.<br>
<br>
<strong>Good luck!</strong><br>
