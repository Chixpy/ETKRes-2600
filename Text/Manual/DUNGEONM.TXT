                    DUNGEON MASTER INSTRUCTIONS

USING YOUR CONTROLS

2. CONTROL STICK: Push the Control Stick in the direction you want
   Winky+ to move.

3. RED BUTTON: Press the Red Button to make Winky+ fire an arrow in
   the direction his bow is pointed.

HERE'S HOW TO PLAY

STEP 1: Choose your skill level.

To select a skill level, move the left and right difficulty switches to the
proper positions (see list below). Winky+ will begin his adventures in
different sections of the dungeon, depending on the skill level you
choose. Skill 1 is the easiest game.

              Skill 1        =           left B/right B
              Skill 2        =           left B/right A
              Skill 3        =           left A/right B
              Skill 4        =           left A/right A

      Next, press Game Reset to start playing.

/* Here comes a graphix showing the main map of the game, with the
 Score indicator in the left upper corner, the Winkies+ remaining
 Indicator in the right upper corner. Some chambers, some HALLMONSTERS+,
 the HALLWAY and of course WINKY+, the little dot starting on a position
 in the middle lower section of the screen. */

STEP 2: Time to explore.

While Winky+ is in the hallway, he appears as a small dot. Beware of the
treacherous Hallmonsters+. Winky's+ arrows CANNOT hurt them.

STEP 3: The chambers within.

To capture treasure move Winky+ into any of the chambers. Each chamber
contains treasure and hazards. Most chambers are full of dangerous
monsters. But the Wall Room has lethal electrified walls instead!

Once Winky+ is inside a chamber, he can shoot arrows at monsters to
defend himself. Remember, in order to score points for shooting a
monster, you must first get to the treasure in that chamber. So seize
the treasure, then rack up a high score by shooting away at the monsters!
But be careful; if Winky+ even touches a monster, living or dead, he
will be eliminated.

(Special hint: Winky+ cannot shoot arrows in the Wall Room Only
clever timing will allow him to capture the treasure there.)

/* Here comes a second graphix, showing the map of a chamber with three
 monsters, WINKY+ as a smiling face, and WINKY'S+ ARROW as a
 dot which you can move around winky. */

STEP 4: An unwelcome visitor.

If Winky+ stays too long in any chamber, a Hallmonster+ will come in
looking for him.

STEP 5: Locked out.

Once you capture the treasure and leave a chamber, you can never return.
(But you CAN return to chambers where you have searched but have not
captured the treasure.)

STEP 6: Deeper into the dungeon.

When you have grabbed the treasure from every chamber. Winky+
descends to a new hall of chambers - and the action gets even harder!
Keep playing until you run out of Winkies+

STARTING OVER

To play again, adjust the difficulty switches to the desired positions, then
press Game Reset.
