<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
</font><font size="4" face="Courier New"><strong>THE EARTH DIES SCREAMING&#153;</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>TO SET UP:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Set up your video computer system and left joystick
controller as instructed in your game system owner's manual. Turn the power OFF. Insert
the game cartridge and then turn the power ON. The Difficulty Switches and Color/B·W
Lever are not used. The Game Select Lever can be used to end a game in progress. Press the
Game Restart Lever or joystick button to start. Get ready to beat the Trillians or bite
the dust!</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>THE OBJECTIVE:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Save the Earth from the diabolical Trillians. They
have set up Attack Bases which launch Kamikaze Satellites and Trillian Fighters. You must
stop them! Every Satellite that gets by you will explode on Earth and drain your energy
sources. Every time your Space Destroyer is hit by Trillian Fighter fire, more energy is
lost. To regain energy, you must seek out a Trillian Attack Base and destroy it. It is
very important to keep your energy level high. If you lose it all, the Trillians will have
a celebration as the Earth dies screaming.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><strong>SCREEN DISPLAY/GAME CONTROLS:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>RADAR SCANNER:</strong> You are at the
control panel of a mighty Space Destroyer armed with a powerful Laser Cannon. The Radar
Scanner at the top of your television screen can detect approaching Trillian Fighters and
Satellites which are not yet visible to the human eye. The Scanner is unable to detect
Trillian Attack Bases at any distance. Trillian Fighters and Satellites are shown on the
Scanner as small white dots. Your Space Destroyer is shown as a large white diamond. The
Radar Scanner shows the battle as seen FROM ABOVE.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>JOYSTICK STEERING:</strong> Using the Radar
Scanner as a guide, steer your Space Destroyer toward the approaching enemy by tilting the
joystick in the appropriate direction. The &quot;scrolling&quot; pattern of the Earth's
surface, the stars visible through the Destroyer Window, and the Radar Scanner show which
direction you are traveling.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>DESTROYER VIEW WINDOW:</strong> When Trillian
craft get closer to Earth, you will be able to see them through the large Destroyer View
Window located in the center of your television screen.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The white &quot;Crosshairs&quot; on the Window is
your Destroyer's gun sight. The Crosshairs show where a laser blast will hit if fired.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Every time you are hit by Trillian fire, the View
Window will flash blue.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Every time you hit a Trillian, the View Window will
flash red.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>JOYSTICK FIRING:</strong> Once you can see a
Trillian through the View Window, your Laser Cannon's automatic tracking system (located
near the bottom of the screen) is activated. Two tracking arms will AUTOMATICALLY follow
the enemy's vertical movement. The Crosshairs will automatically stay &quot;locked
in&quot; to the height level of the enemy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">You must steer the Laser Cannon to the right or left
to aim at your target. Press the joystick button to fire. Your Laser Cannon has an
unlimited supply of ammunition, so don't be shy about blasting away.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>GAME STATUS BAR:</strong> Your current score
is shown in the center of the Game Status Bar at the bottom of your television screen.
After each game, the high score since the cartridge was last inserted or the power last
turned on will be shown there. The two blocks on either end of the Status Bar change color
during the game to show your Destroyer's and the Earth's energy levels.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>STATUS CODE:</strong></font></p>

<pre><font size="3">   GREEN = Energy level high
  YELLOW = Destroyer's energy level is critical
     RED = Earth's energy level is critical</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">When either energy level is critical, you will also
be warned by an alarm. At this point, you must either get more energy by blasting a
Trillian Base or prepare for the end.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Courier New"><strong>TRILLIANS/GAINING AND LOSING ENERGY:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>KAMIKAZE SATELLITES</strong> are programmed
to explode upon reaching Earth. If any of these winged bombs get past you and reach their
target, strength will be drained from the energy field which is protecting the Earth.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>TRILLIAN FIGHTER</strong> are headed toward
Earth for some heavy duty bombing. They are programmed to destroy anything that gets in
their way. This means you! If you are hit by enemy fire, you will lose energy. Dodge the
blasts whenever you can. If a Fighter gets past you, it will bomb the Earth and drain
strength from Earth's energy field.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>RETURNING FIGHTERS</strong> have a white bar
across the back of the ship (not shown in the screen illustration). If you can keep a
Returning Fighter in your View Window for five seconds, a Trillian Base will appear.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Destroying a <strong>TRILLIAN ATTACK BASE</strong> is
the only way you can GAIN energy. If you lose track of a Trillian Base, you will have to
follow another Returning Fighter to another Base.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Courier New"><strong>SCORING:</strong></font></p>

<pre>   KAMIKAZE SATELLITE =  825 Points
     TRILLIAN FIGHTER =  975 Points
    RETURNING FIGHTER = 1250 Points
        TRILLIAN BASE = 1500 Points</pre>

<p><font size="4" face="Courier New"><strong>LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The Earth Dies Screaming gets more difficult as you
continue to play. Even so, a skilled player should be able to dodge enemy fire.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Courier New"><strong>HINTS FROM DAN THOMPSON...</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Keep your thumb on the fire button. Once you have a
Trillian in the View Window, TRUST the automatic tracking system to keep the Crosshairs at
the same height as the Trillian. Then all you need to do is tilt the joystick right or
left to aim your fire.</font></p>
