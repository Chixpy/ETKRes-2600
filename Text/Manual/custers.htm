CUSTER'S REVENGE<br>
<br>
USE JOYSTICK CONTROLLER<br>
<br>
<br>
Foreplay<br>
<br>
The object of the game is to use your joystick control to advance Custer<br>
across the TV screen and &quot;score&quot; as many times as you can with the beautiful<br>
maiden, all the time trying to avoid the arrows, and in game numbers 3 and 4<br>
the prickly cactus as well.<br>
When the game starts, Custer has three lives. Every time he is hit by an <br>
arrow, he goes into his little dance and loses one life. In games 3 and 4,<br>
if he runs into a cactus, he'll go into a different dance, but he still<br>
loses a life. When all the lives are lost the game is over. Small cactuses<br>
on the black stripe at the bottom of the screen show how many lives are<br>
remaining in addition to the one then in play.<br>
<br>
Scoring<br>
<br>
When Custer successfully reaches the maiden, repeatedly depress the &quot;fire&quot;<br>
button. Do not hold it down. You receive one point for each time you &quot;score&quot;.<br>
So press it over and over again as rapidly as you can. Watch how the maiden<br>
smiles and kicks up her heels and Custer &quot;flips his lid&quot;. As Custer
&quot;scores&quot;<br>
a fanfare of Charge is played. You do not have to wait for the tune to finish<br>
to &quot;score&quot; again. Just keep pressing the button over and over again.<br>
<br>
Game Play<br>
<br>
Custer's Revenge (tm) consists of two game versions, each with a one or<br>
two player option. With the power shut off, gently insert your Mystique (tm)<br>
video game cartridge into your Atari (R) or Sears (R) console in the same<br>
manner as you would with any compatible game cartridge. Turning the power<br>
switch to &quot;on&quot; will activate the &quot;foreplay&quot; mode. This is very similar
to <br>
the &quot;Attract&quot; mode seen on many arcade games. You will hear the Cavalry<br>
Charge Song followed by the Indian War Dance music. Once the music stops<br>
playing you can start the game.<br>
Games numbers 1 and 3 are one-player versions and 2 and 4 are two-player<br>
versions. In games 1 and 2 you need only avoid the arrows. Games 3 and 4 are<br>
more difficult in that you must avoid the cactus in addition to the arrows.<br>
Use the game select switch on your console to select your game choice. The<br>
number of the game appears on a color stripe above the Mystique (tm) name<br>
near the bottom of the screen. Use the left joystick control for the one-<br>
player games and both joysticks for the two-player games.<br>
Once you have selected the game, either depress the &quot;game reset&quot; button<br>
on your console, or the red &quot;fire&quot; button on the left joystick control. This<br>
will start the &quot;play&quot; mode and the two musical themes are then repeated. At<br>
the end of the music the tom-toms begin to beat, the arrows start flying and<br>
it's time to start playing.<br>
Moving the joystick to the right will cause Custer to face right and walk<br>
to the right. Moving the joystick to the left causes Custer to face left and<br>
walk to the left. Moving the joystick up or down or leaving it in the center<br>
will cause Custer to &quot;halt&quot;.<br>
<br>
Arrows<br>
<br>
The trick is to avoid the arrows. They will cost you a life if they hit in<br>
a line with Custer's hat. However it is possible to stand between 2 arrows<br>
and not get hit. When Custer gets hit by an arrow, lightning and thunder<br>
strike, he grabs his bottom, jumps out of his boots and does his dance to<br>
the tune of Taps.<br>
The large cactus plants on the screens of games 3 and 4 will appear and<br>
disappear at random intervals. If any part of Custer touches the cactus when<br>
it appears, it will cost one life. When this occurs, Custer goes into a <br>
different dance, pointing to his wounded pride, and once again passing on to<br>
the tune of Taps.<br>
<br>
Bonus Lives<br>
<br>
For every 50 points Custer scores (you receive one point each time he<br>
scores), you will be awarded a bonus life. You can accumulate no more than<br>
6 lives at any one time, in addition to the one in play.<br>
<br>
Two Player Option<br>
<br>
When the two player option is selected, the first player (using the left<br>
joystick -- red score stripe) plays until a life is lost. The second player<br>
(right joystick -- green score stripe) then plays until a life is lost.<br>
Turns continue to alternate until one player has lost all their lives. The<br>
other player then continues until their remaining lives are lost. When this<br>
occurs, the game is over and players' final scores are displayed simultan-<br>
eously on the screen, meanwhile the unit returns to the &quot;Attract&quot; or <br>
&quot;foreplay&quot; mode.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Levels<br>
<br>
With the difficulty switch in the &quot;A&quot; position the arrows initially move<br>
at a slow speed. Upon reaching 50 points, a bonus life is awarded, Custer<br>
returns to the left side of the screen and the arrows speed up to the<br>
&quot;intermediate&quot; speed, significantly increasing the difficulty of avoiding<br>
the arrows. Upon reaching 100 points, another bonus life is awarded; Custer<br>
returns to the left part of the screen again and the speed of the arrows<br>
increases to &quot;fast&quot;. In essence, the better you get, the harder it gets to<br>
&quot;score&quot;.<br>
By moving the difficulty switch to the &quot;B&quot; position, all speeds are <br>
increased. <br>
With two-players it is possible for one player to use the slower speed and<br>
the other player to use the faster speed for handicap purposes.<br>
<br>
After Play<br>
<br>
The world of electronic video games is a most exciting concept. It uses <br>
computer generated images to challenge the player's imagination; to create <br>
a fantasy situation that offers a challenge.<br>
Until Mystique (tm), video games have been considered by many to be <br>
&quot;child's play&quot; (because they usually beat the adults). But here's a game kids <br>
can't play (so you stand a chance of winning).<br>
We at Mystique (tm) feel that it's time for video games and their adult <br>
players to come out of the closet, away from the kids, and deal with ADULT <br>
fantasies. After all, grown-ups have been known to be imaginative and comp-<br>
etitive, as well as have fantasies.<br>
We have designed our &quot;Adult&quot; games to be whimsical, entertaining, challeng-<br>
ing, naughty and FUN. Our own team of design engineers has developed a line <br>
of games that don't just stop at &quot;Adult&quot;, but push the Atari console to the <br>
limit. You'll see graphics of a quality that you probably have never seen <br>
before. You'll hear music and sound effects where you've come to expect only <br>
an occasional &quot;bleep&quot; before. Nearly every bit of capability of the Atari <br>
2600 is used.<br>
It is our desire to provide you with not only the finest in adult video <br>
games, but with a level of quality -- play, graphics, effects and humor -- <br>
rarely found in any video game -- adult or not. We want you to laugh, smile <br>
a lot, have a challenge and enjoy! Any suggestions for improvement are <br>
welcome. Compliments are adored. However, we'd love to hear from you either <br>
way.<br>
<br>
P.S. If the kids catch you and should ask, tell them Custer and the maiden<br>
are just dancing.<br>
