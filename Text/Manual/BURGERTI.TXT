M-Network Burgertime Instructions  4518-0950
========================================================================
(For 1 or 2 Players)

Build beautiful burgers by dropping buns and patties onto a plate. 
Dodge horrible hot dog.  Defy brawling bread sticks.  Pepper enormous
eggs and charging cheese.  Score points by squashing those nasties with
a falling bun.  Build all the burgers and you move on to the next maze. 
Get too close to a nasty, though, and it's back to Burger School for you
in short order.

THE GAME
========================================================================
You move your chef around the maze in a frantic attempt to build
hamburgers before the nasties converge on you.  Move across the top of
the burger ingredients and they will drop a level.  Work all the
ingredients to the bottom and you'll move on to the next maze.  Score
points by dropping an ingredient, squashing nasties, or giving them a
ride down on a falling ingredient.  Dust a nasty with some pepper and
he'll stop in his tracks.  If a nasty toches him, your chef is cooked. 
So watch out!  Play alone or challenge a friend.  Highest score wins.

(page 2)

CONTROLLERS
========================================================================
Use your LEFT joystick controller to control the direction of your
chef.  Be sure your controller cable is securely plugged into the back
of your game console.  Hold the controller so the red PEPPER BUTTON is
to your UPPER LEFT.  NOTE: Right hand controller is not used in this
game.

DIFFICULTY SWITCHES
========================================================================
LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY DOES NOT CHANGE.  The switch on the RIGHT (neaer the
right controller cable) determines the number of players.  Switch
position A is for two players.  Switch position B is for one player.  IN
SWITCH POSITION A, THE TWO PLAYERS TAKE TURNS USING THE LEFT
CONTROLLER.  When on eplayer loses his chef, the other player takes over
the controller.

The switch on the LEFT may be used to FREEZE THE ACTION by sliding it in
to position A.  Position B returns the game to the action from the point
at which you stopped it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roll up your sleeves...Put on your hat...Grab some pepper...and fire up
your grill!

(page 3)

ACTION!
========================================================================
TO START THE GAME, PRESS THE RESET SWITCH.  BE READY BECAUSE THE GAME
STARTS RIGHT AWAY.

THE CHEF  You control the chef, PETER PEPPER. (tm)  Move him up ladders
and across planks using the joystick.  Move your chef completely across
a bun or other ingredient and it drops one level.  You rack up 50
points.

You start with 5 chefs, but only one can be used at a time.  For every
10,000 points scored, you get an extra chef.

NASTIES AND MAZES  Hot dogs, eggs, breadsticks, and cheese chase your
chef wherever he goes in the maze.  If they catch him, the round is
over.  All the nasties get quicker as you go along.

There are five mazes constructed of ladders and planks.  When you
successfully build all the hamburgerse in one maze, you move on to the
next maze.  When all five mazes have been completed, you start over with
the first maze.

(page 4)

FOR MORE POINTS DROP the ingredients ON TOP of the nasties.  You will
get 200 points for each hot dog or bread stick that you squash.  A
squashed egg or hunk of cheese is worth 100 points.

FOR EVEN MORE POINTS, tempt the nasties out onto a bun and then drop in
nby stepping off.  The bun will drop TWO levels.  You score 500 points
for each nasty you srop.  After a  few seconds, dropped or squashed
nasties return from the side of the screen.

AND A PINCH OF PEPPER Pepper may be used to temporarily stun nasties if
you are trapped.  This tactic allows you to move ou of corners
unharmed.  You can only throw pepper IN FRONT OF YOU.  MAKE SURE THE
CHEF IS FACING THE NASTY YOU WANT TO PEPPER BY USING THE JOYSTICK FIRST.

You start with 5 pinches of pepper, which are displayed under and to the
left of the score.  (See Diagram.)  You can earn extra pinches of pepper
by gobbling French fries, ice cream, or coffee.  You get 500 points and
a pinch of pepper for each item gobbled.

THE CHEF WILL ALWAYS STOP WHILE HE THROWS THE PEPPER.  You can move him
as soon as he is finished peppering the nasty.

SCORE DISPLAY:  The running score is tallied in the top center portion
of the screen.  But, anytime you SQUASH a nasty or give on a ride down,
the point value will be displayed briefly instead of the score.

                                SCORE
                                002850
                                06  04
                            NUMBER  NUMBER
                        OF PEPPERS  OF CHEFS


(page 5)

For two player games, only the score of the player currently controlling
the chefis displayed.  At the end of the game, the display alternated
showing each score and designates whether it belongs to player #1 (pink)
or player #2 (blue).

The MAXIMUM SCORE for M Network BURGERTIME is 999,950.  If you can get
close, you are a certified burger-maniac.

WINNING TIPS
=========================================================================
SAVE PEPPER for the times you need it most.  Don't waste it on nasties
that are easily avoided.

Try to get the HIGHEST point value for EACH hamburger part that you
drop.  Try SQUASHING a nasty!  Better yet give him a fast ride down on a
falling bun!

REMEMBER, your chef STOPS while he peppers a nasty.  Don't get blind
sided by a marauding bread stick while you're busy peppering a hot dog.

Keep away from the corners after squashing a nasty or giving him a
ride.  The same nasty could return in that corner and could run right
smack into your chef.
