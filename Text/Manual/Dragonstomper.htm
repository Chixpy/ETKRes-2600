<p><big><strong>How to Use the <br>
Starpath Supercharger </strong></big>

<ul>
  <li>Set up your Atari Video Computer System (or any similar game system that takes Video
    Computer System game cartridges) according to manufacturer instructions. Use joystick
    controllers. </li>
  <li>Make sure power switch is OFF, and insert the Starpath Supercharger with label up. Be
    careful not to force it or to insert it crookedly. </li>
  <li>Connect the plug on the end of the Supercharger cable to the earphone jack of any
    cassette recorder/ player.* (This jack may also be labeled &quot;monitor,&quot;
    &quot;mon.,&quot; &quot;ear,&quot; or &quot;output.&quot;) </li>
  <li>For best results, keep the cassette player at least a few inches away from the TV set. </li>
  <li>Turn the power switch of the game ON. The TV screen should read &quot;REWIND TAPE PRESS
    PLAY.&quot; If not, turn the power off and check to be sure the system is properly hooked
    up and the Supercharger is fully inserted. </li>
  <li>Insert Side A of DRAGONSTOMPER. Side A of the cassette is quick load side; Side B is the
    standard load side. Some cassette players may not load reliably on the quick load side. If
    so, flip the tape over and use Side B. </li>
  <li>Set volume and tone controls near high or maximum. </li>
  <li>Press REWIND and wait until the tape stops moving. Now press PLAY.</li>
  <li>In a few moments, you will hear the sounds of the game loading and see colored panels
    fill the screen. A moment later &quot;STOP TAPE&quot; will appear, and you'll be ready to
    play DRAGONSTOMPER. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have trouble... 

<ul>
  <li>If the tape player makes a screeching noise, you have not plugged the Supercharger cable
    into the earphone jack.</li>
  <li>If the tape doesn't move, check the batteries in the cassette player. </li>
  <li>Rewind the tape completely and try again. </li>
  <li>Try Side B of the game cassette if Side A won't load properly. Set volume and tone
    controls at high or maximum. </li>
  <li>Move the cassette player farther from the TV set and try again. </li>
</ul>

<p><small>* If you use a large cassette deck with a &quot;phone&quot; type earphone plug,<br>
you may purchase an adapter at most electronics specialty stores.</small></p>

<p><big><strong>Only the Dragonstomper Can Save the Kingdom... </strong></big></p>

<p>Once this was a happy place to live. There was plenty to eat and drink, and the
children could play safely in the forests. The King was wise and ruled with a gentle hand.
</p>

<p>Then a Druid magician completed the enchantment of a powerful amulet. The amulet,
thought the Druid, would subdue the dragon. The Druid, controlling the fierce beast, would
become invincible. So, amulet in hand, the Druid magician entered the dragon's cave. </p>

<p>And fell into a trap. </p>

<p>The amulet skidded out of the Druid's hand...and into the dragon's claw. The Druid fled
in terror. The dragon lay still, puzzled and fascinated.</p>

<p>Slowly, the magic powers of the amulet flowed into the dragon. To his physical strength
were added cunning, intelligence, and far greater magical powers. As the dragon gained
power, he became obsessed with evil. And he turned the full force of his evil powers
against the once happy Kingdom. </p>

<p>From his cave, the dragon cast spells that caused crops to parch and die. Hidden pools
of quicksand snared travelers on their way to village markets, Savage creatures-- maniacs,
scorpions, demented monkeys, and worse-- attacked without warning or provocation. </p>

<p>The Kingdom became a desperate and treacherous place. The King's loyal knights had all
fallen to the dragon's evil warriors. The King's Wizard was helpless against the dragon's
magic. There was only one hope left. </p>

<p><strong>The Dragonstomper</strong>. <br>
So here's where you come in. As the fabled Dragonstomper, you'll need all your wits,
strength, intuition, and resourcefulness to dispatch the evil that hangs over the Kingdom.
First, you must battle your way across the countryside, giving the dragon's creatures a
taste of your blade. Then, you must prepare yourself for the big brawl, recruiting men and
supplies from the oppressed village. Finally, you must conquer the dragon and smash the
evil amulet. </p>

<p><strong>Another day in the life of a Dragonstomper. </strong></p>

<p><big><strong>Fighting Your Way to the Dragon's Cave</strong></big></p>

<p><strong>Dragonstomper is a Multi Load game. </strong><br>
The three levels of Dragonstomper play are far too complex to be loaded into the Starpath
Supercharger cartridge at one time. So the game cassette is divided into three sections,
each of which is loaded separately from your cassette player into the computer memory of
the Supercharger: 

<ul>
  <li>Load One: The Enchanted Countryside </li>
  <li>Load Two: The Oppressed Village </li>
  <li>Load Three: The Dragon's Cave</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Important </em>Be sure to press the STOP button on your cassette recorder as soon
as the STOP TAPE message appears. If you're too slow, you may let the tape run past the
beginning of the next load. </p>

<p>Even if you miss the beginning of the next load, no problem. A REWIND TAPE message
appears, and you should rewind the tape back to the beginning. The Supercharger will find
the correct load automatically and, when it's loaded, a STOP TAPE message will appear. Be
patient, and let the tape pass through the unwanted loading cycles. </p>

<p><strong>The Enchanted Countryside </strong><br>
Your objective during your trek across the countryside is to obtain the power and magic
you need to get into the village. You start with 400 gold pieces and a good deal of
strength and dexterity. But not enough to take you across the bridge into the village. </p>

<p>You'll have to fight the dragon's creatures, taking possession of their gold, spells,
and weapons. Once you have enough, you can bargain with the guard at the bridge. </p>

<p>But be careful, because each battle can cost you some of your strength. And when your
strength is all gone, you're a dead Dragonstomper: </p>

<p><strong>The Oppressed Village </strong><br>
Your objective during your stay in the village is to equip yourself with what you need to
battle the dragon. The shops have a variety of provisions you may find useful. Enter the
Magic Shop, the Trade Shop, or the Hospital and buy or barter what you need. </p>

<p>You'll find the few warriors in the village, but you'll have to use your wits before
they'll join you in your journey into the dragon's cave. </p>

<p>Once you're satisfied that you've got what it takes to take on the dragon, just step up
to the cave's gate. But you better be absolutely sure you're ready. There is no turning
back. </p>

<p><strong>The Dragon's Cave </strong><br>
Now we'll find out if you're worthy of the name Dragonstomper. </p>

<p>Proceed into the cave with care. It's riddled with traps, snares, and guardians. It's
also riddled with the bones of other would-be dragon stompers. </p>

<p>You'll need all the strength and magic at your disposal to survive this adventure. </p>

<p><big><strong>How to Play </strong></big></p>

<p><em>Start the game </em>by loading the cassette into the Supercharger and picking up
your left joystick. </p>

<p><em>To move </em>across the landscape, just push the joystick in the direction you wish
to travel. You can move when the message area at the bottom of the screen reads: </p>

<pre>    ##    ##      
    ##    ######  USE
  ######  ##      STICK
                  TO
      ##  ######  MOVE
  ######    ##  
      ##    ##</pre>

<p><em>To deal with adversaries </em>you can choose to MOVE, FIGHT, or USE a weapon or
magic spell. When the screen shows the &quot;action menu&quot; below, push the joystick in
the direction of the arrow next to the action you wish to take: </p>

<pre>    ##
    ##      MOVE
  ######

  ##
  ######    FIGHT
  ##

      ##
  ######    USE
      ##

  ######
    ##      STATUS
    ##</pre>

<p><em>When fighting</em>, you'll find that the battles are given blow-by-blow
descriptions on the message block. Every time your adversary scores a hit, you'll see how
much of your strength was lost. The less strength and dexterity you have left, the more
likely you are to get the worst of a battle. When your strength is low, you'd better MOVE
on. </p>

<p><em>To learn your status, </em>you press the joystick button and the &quot;action
menu&quot; appears. Push the joystick in the indicated direction, and you'll see how much
gold, strength, dexterity, and useful objects you possess. (Note that there are times
during combat when you can't switch to the &quot;action menu.&quot;) </p>

<pre>  0603    GOLD
    14    STR
    16    DEX
   ###    INVENTORY
    #</pre>

<p>Pushing the joystick in the INVENTORY direction shows you how many of each object
you've accumulated. When you have more than three object types, you can review them all by
calling for MORE. </p>

<p><em>To use various objects,</em> during a battle or at any other time, select USE from
the action menu. Then the message area shows which objects are available (you may need the
MORE command to call up all the objects), and you need only push the joystick in the
appropriate direction to use it. </p>

<pre>    ##
    ##      GOLD
  ######

  ##
  ######    CHEST
  ##

      ##
  ######    KEY
      ##

  ######
    ##      MORE
    ##</pre>

<p><em>To resurrect yourself</em> if you drop dead during the first load (if your strength
drops below zero), just press RESET. You'll lose all your magic objects, but you'll have a
fresh supply of gold, strength, and dexterity. </p>

<p><strong><big>Be a Better </big><br>
<big>Dragonstomper </big></strong></p>

<p><em>When your strength is down,</em> stay out of fights until you build it up again.
Your strength builds gradually with time. A more dramatic increase in strength may be
obtained by visiting church and making a suitable contribution. </p>

<p><em>Think before you fight. </em>Your adversaries will wear you down if you battle them
mindlessly. Try USEing an appropriate object during the first exchange of blows. Or just
MOVE along if you don't think you need any objects in your adversary's possession. </p>

<p><em>Watch out for booby traps. </em>Don't get fooled by a seemingly peaceful landscape.
The cunning dragon has laid traps by the front entrance to certain castles. Try the back
entrance. </p>

<p><em>Get by the bridge guard,</em> the easy way. He's too tough to fight. So give him
lots of gold. Or, even easier, show him your scroll as identification. </p>

<p><em>The clever Dragonstomper</em> can prove he is smarter than the dragon by outwitting
him and stealing the amulet. The dragon can then be rehabilitated instead of killed. </p>
