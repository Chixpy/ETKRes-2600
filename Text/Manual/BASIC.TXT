BASIC PROGRAMMING





INTRODUCTION





BASIC PROGRAMMING is an instructional tool designed to teach you the
fundamental steps of computer programming.  BASIC is an acronym for
Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.  It was originated to
that people could easily learn to "write" computer programs.





Computer programs are simply a series of instructions.  The programs
control the flow of information within the computer.  BASIC PROGRAMMING
allows you to give the Video Computer System(tm) the instructions it
needs to carry out some simple tasks.





Keep in mind that BASIC PROGRAMMING has a limited amount of memory in
comparison to more sophisticated computer systems.  It is, however, an
excellent instructional device for learning the essentials of computer
programming.





NOTE:  Turn the console off when inserting or removing a Game
Program(tm).  This will protect the electronic components and prolong
the life of your Atari(R) Video Computer System.





This Game Program may cause some television screens to "roll" slightly.
If this occurs, adjustment of the VERTICAL HOLD may be necessary.





KEYBOARD CONTROLLERS





Use your Keyboard Controllers with this ATARI(R) Game Program.(tm)  Be
sure the Controllers are firmly plugged into the LEFT and RIGHT
CONTROLLER jacks at the rear of your ATARI Video Computer System.(tm)





To connect the two controllers, slide the tongue of the left controller
into the groove on the right controller.  The two Keyboard Controllers,
locked together, form a 24-key Keyboard used to enter your program and
to control the display on your television screen.





(Transcriber's note:  The above paragraph is accompanied by a line
drawing of the keyboard controllers partially fitted together.  Below
that is a reproduction of the keyboard labels.  See the end of this
manual for a transcription of the labels.)





Remove the Keyboard Controller labels from the envelope.  Place the
label marked LEFT over the Keyboard plugged into the LEFT CONTROLLER
jack at the rear of your computer console.  Place the label marked RIGHT
over the Keyboard plugged into the RIGHT CONTROLLER jack at the rear of
your computer console.





DISPLAY REGIONS





The display is divided into six regions:





1.  The PROGRAM region is used to give the computer your instructions.





2.  The STACK region will give you the temporary results of your program
     as the computer is running it.





3.  The VARIABLES region will give you the value of each variable item
     in your program as the computer is running it.





4.  The OUTPUT region will show you the output being produced as your
     program is being run.





5.  The STATUS region shows you the amount of memory available at any
     time for your program.  This region will also give you the speed of
     execution of your program.





6.  The GRAPHICS region has two colored squares which can be moved
     around under your program control.





Before beginning your program, place the left difficulty switch in the b
position.  This will show you where each region is on your display.
When the left difficulty switch is place in the a position, the titles
of each region will disappear from the display and the GRAPHICS region
will come into view.





The right difficulty switch has no function in this Game Program.

THE CURSOR





Place the left difficulty switch into the b position and turn your
console off and then on again.  In the PROGRAM region there is a white
rectangle.  This is the cursor.  Locate the "shift control key" at the
center of the bottom row on the left controller.  Push this key four
times.  The color of the cursor will change from white to red, from red
to blue, from blue to green, and from green to white again.





The cursor is used to input your program.  Each of the four colors on
the shift key corresponds to the colored commands or inputs on your
Keyboard.  The white mode is used to give your computer commands, the
other modes are used to insert symbols into your program.





Moving the Cursor from Region to Region





Make sure the left difficulty switch is in the b position and turn your
console unit off and then on again.  Push the FORWARD key and the cursor
will move from PROGRAM to STACK.  Press the FORWARD key again and the
cursor will move from STACK to VARIABLES.  Push the key again and the
cursor will move from VARIABLES to OUTPUT.





By pushing the BACKWARD key you can move the cursor back to the PROGRAM
region.  The FORWARD and BACKWARD keys can be pushed once for each
region or held down.





Now place the left difficulty switch into the a position.  The titles of
each region will disappear and a portion of the GRAPHICS region will
appear.  Step the cursor through each of the regions again.  Notice that
the cursor will not move into the GRAPHICS region.





Removing the Regions from the Display





Place the left difficulty switch into the b position again and turn your
console unit off and then on.  On the left side of the Keyboard are a
series of commands (white mode) that correspond with each of the
regions:  STATUS, PROGRAM, STACK, VARIABLES, OUTPUT, and GRAPHICS.
Let's start with the STATUS region.  Push the STATUS key once and the
STATUS region will disappear from the screen and the PROGRAM region will
move to the top of the display.





Push the PROGRAM key and the PROGRAM region will disappear and the STACK
region will move to the top of the display.  Push the STACK key and the
STACK region will disappear and the VARIABLES region will move to the
top of the display.  Push the VARIABLES key and the VARIABLES region
will disappear causing the OUTPUT region to move to the top of the
display.





Remove the OUTPUT region by pushing the OUTPUT key.  This will also
cause the GRAPHICS region to be fully visible on the display.  Push the
GRAPHICS key to remove the GRAPHICS region.  Your display should show no
regions.





Now push the STACK key.  The STACK region will reappear on your display.
Remove the STACK region, and bring up the OUTPUT and VARIABLES regions.
You may display or remove any region with the left difficulty switch in
either the a or b position.





It is important to note that whether or not the various regions are
displayed has no effect on the execution of a program.





RUNNING A PROGRAM





Let's do a simple program.  Make sure the left difficulty switch is in
the b position and turn your console unit off and then on again.
(Another way to erase a program and reset all values is to depress the
game select switch.  Pushing the game reset switch erases all values and
returns a program to its beginning without erasing the program.)





Remove the STACK, VARIABLES, OUTPUT, and GRAPHICS regions from the
display.  The cursor will be in the white mode and to the right of the
number 1 in the PROGRAM region.  Change the cursor to the blue mode and
push the A key.  The letter A will appear on the display next to the 1.
(Each line is numbered, making it possible to see where one line ends
and the next one begins.)  Now change the cursor to the red mode and
push the ! key.  A small arrow will appear next to the A.  Now go back
to blue and input B.  Changing the cursor to red, input + and the number
2.  Now go back to the white mode and input New Line.  You must always
be in the white mode in order to start a new line in your program.





Your display should look like this.





STATUS

SYMBOLS=57

SPEED=30

PROGRAM

1 A!B=2

2






(Transcriber's note:  remember that I'm using ! to indicate the left
arrow symbol)





If you make an error in entering your program, it can be erased using
the ERASE key.  Notice that the ERASE key is not color coded.  It can be
used when the shift key is in any color mode.





Using the line that you have just entered into your program, let's do an
exercise.  Push the ERASE key once.  The cursor will move from line 2
directly to the right of the 2 on line 1.  Push the ERASE key again and
the 2 will be erased from the program.  Now enter 1, using the red mode.
Change the cursor to the white mode and using the BACKWARD key, move the
cursor until it is directly to the right of the B in the program.  Push
the ERASE key and the letter will be removed from the program.  Now
replace it with A (blue mode).  In the white mode, use the FORWARD key
to move to the end of line 1 and input New Line.





Remember that the cursor should not be on the symbol to be erased but
directly to the right of it.  Your screen display will now look like
this:





STATUS

SYMBOLS=57

SPEED=30

PROGRAM

1 A!A+1

2






The cursor is directly to the right of the 2 in line 2.  Now input PRINT
using the green mode.  Then, with the blue mode, input A and go to a New
Line.  Your display will look like this:





STATUS

SYMBOLS=54

SPEED=30

PROGRAM

1 A!A+1

2 Print A

3






Now, with the cursor in the green mode, input GOTO, and then, in the red
mode, input 1.  Before we do anything else, let's look at the display
again.





STATUS

SYMBOLS=52

SPEED=30

PROGRAM

1 A!A+1

2 Print A

3 Goto 1






Notice that the STATUS region shows we have 52 "bytes" or symbols of
memory remaining.  The speed is set at 30 (SPEED=30).  Put the cursor
into the white mode and depress the SLOWER key.  Notice that every time
you depress this key the speed decreases.  Depress the FASTER key and
the SPEED will increase.





Before we start the program, input SPEED=1.  Now depress the STACK key.
Press the RUN/HALT key twice and the program will begin.  You can watch
the computer work each part of the program.





STATUS

SYMBOLS=41

SPEED=1

PROGRAM

1 A!A+1

2 Print A

3 Goto 1

STACK

A!3






To stop the program press RUN/HALT.  As noted before, pressing the game
reset switch erases all values in your program (without erasing the
program itself), and returns the program to its beginning.





Let's analyze the program step by step as the computer runs through it.
Change SPEED to 60.  With the cursor in the white mode depress the STEP
key.  This will take each part of the program one step at a time, each
time it is pressed.





In line 1 the program reads A!A+1.  The computer reads this as A
"becomes" A+1.  Watch the STACK region as you step through line 1.  In
line 2, you have told the computer in Print A.  This means you want the
computer to print the value of A (as determined by line 1) in the OUTPUT
region.





We'll see how that works later.  Line 3 tells the computer to Goto 1.
The computer is to return to line 1 and find a new value for A.  Each
time the program is run through it will find a new value for A, print
that value, and then return to line 1.  The computer will continue to
run through the program in this manner until all the "memory" is used.
The amount of remaining memory is shown in the SYMBOLS area of the
STATUS region.





Bring up the VARIABLES region on the display.  Change the SPEED to 1 and
clear the values of the program by pressing the game reset switch.  Push
the RUN/HALT key and watch as the computer runs through the program.
The computer will show you the current value of A at each step of your
program.  Your screen display will look like this:





STATUS

SYMBOLS=27

SPEED=1

PROGRAM

1 A!A+1

2 Print A

3 Goto 1

STACK

Print 11

VARIABLES

A is 11






Stop the program and clear the values (game reset).  Remove the
VARIABLES region and bring up the OUTPUT region on the display.  Change
SPEED to 60.  The display will now look like this:





STATUS

SYMBOLS=52

SPEED 60

PROGRAM

1 A!A+1

2 Print A

3 Goto 1

STACK






OUTPUT





Press the RUN/HALT key and start the program.  In line 2, the computer
is instructed to PRINT A.  When it reaches this command, it will bring
the current value of A in the OUTPUT region.  Watch the SYMBOLS area of
the STATUS region.  Even though 1 shows in the OUTPUT region on your
display, the computer is still printing the changing value of A.  Put
the left difficulty switch in the a position.
Your display will now look something like this:





SYMBOLS=2

SPEED=60

1 A!A+1

2 Print A

3 Goto1






Print12





1

2

3

How can we show more of the OUTPUT region on the display?  Remove the
STATUS, PROGRAM, and STACK regions from the display.  Your display will
look like this:





1

2

3

4

5

6

7

8

9

10

11






Suppose we don't want to overload the OUTPUT region of the program?
Stop the program and erase the values with the game reset switch.
Remove the OUTPUT region from the display and bring up the PROGRAM
region.  Using the FORWARD key, move the cursor to the end of line 1, so
that your display looks like this:





1 A!A+1

2 Print A

3 Goto 1






Now depress the NEW LINE key.  We will insert a new command here.  Input
CLEAR (green mode).  Your display will look like this:





1 A!A+1

2 Clear

3 Print A

4 Goto 1






Bring up STACK, VARIABLES and OUTPUT.  Leave the left difficulty switch
in the a position and start the program.  As the program passes line
2 CLEAR it erases the value of A in the OUTPUT region and the prints the
next value of A in line 3.





BASIC PROGRAMMING can only work with two-digit numbers, so as it reaches
99 it will "wraparound" and begin again showing A's value to be 0.





USING THE NOTE FUNCTION





Each time the program stores a number into NOTE (red mode), a note from
the musical scale will be sounded by your television speaker.





Let's do some programs to demonstrate.  If you have any programs in your
Video Computer System, depress the game select switch on the console
unit.





Input the following:





1 Note!Note+1

2 Goto 1






Now start the program.  Slow the program down and watch it being worked
in the STACK region.  Also notice that the program will print the
current value of NOTE in the VARIABLES region.





Stop the program and insert a new line 2 (in the white mode, move the
cursor to the end of line 1 and press NEW LINE.  The previous line 2
will become line 3).





2 If Note>6 Then Note!0





Your display will look like this:

(IF STACK and VARIABLES regions are removed.)





1 Note!Note+1

2 If Note>6 Then Note

!0

3 Goto 1






With the IF and THEN commands, we are instructing the program that IF
something happens, THEN it is to do something else.  In this case, IF
Note is more than 6, THEN Note is to be changed to 0.  Start the program
and watch it being worked in the STACK region.  Notice that as the value
of Note reaches 7, it becomes more then (>) 6 and the program changes
the value to 0.





Let's do another program to achieve the same result in a different way.
Input the following:





1 Note!C

2 C!C+1

3 If C>7 Then C!0

4 Goto 1






Run the program.  Notice that the same results are achieved, except that
the notes are spaced evenly.  If you want the program to give you the
value of C in the OUTPUT region, input Print C and Clear as instructions
anywhere in the program.  To cut down on the flicker in the OUTPUT
region as the program is giving you the value, insert a comma, (green
mode) after the value in the Print line, Print C.





You may use any letter of the alphabet for the variable in your
programs.  The following program has all the key functions we have
learned so far and uses nearly all the available "memory" in the
computer.  After entering this program, remove the program from the
display, bring up the STATUS, STACK, and OUTPUT regions, and run the
program.





In this program we have given two IF/THEN commands.  If the conditions
set up in the first command are not met (line 4) the computer will move
to the next line (line 5).  Given enough memory, there can be several
commands between any two IF/THEN commands.





In some cases we can put two commands on one line, as in line 1 and line
2 in the above program.  In this way we can save some of the memory for
later in the program.





USING THE KEY AND PRINT FUNCTIONS





The KEY function (red mode) is used to input a variable while the
program is running.  The program will evaluate KEY and replace it with a
number that you input from the right side of the Keyboard.  If no number
is inputted, then the program will read KEY as 0.





Here's a simple program using the KEY function:





SYMBOLS=50

SPEED=30






1 If Key>0 Then Note!

Key

2 Goto 1






Start the program and push some of the keys on the right side of the
Keyboard.  With practice you may be able to play a tune.





The KEY function can also be used for programming in the GRAPHICS region
as we will see later.





Try this program using the KEY, NOTE, and PRINT functions:





SYMBOLS=34

SPEED=30

1 A!Key

2 Note!A Print A

3 If A=0 Then Clear

4 Goto 1






9





Watch this program in the OUTPUT region.  Notice that as you input a
number from the right side of the Keyboard the program will play that
tone and display that number in the OUTPUT region.





Now let's make a minor modification in the program.  In line 2, insert a
comma (,) after Print A and start the program.  By inserting the comma
here you have told the program that you want as many of the variables
printed on one line as possible.





USING THE PRINT FUNCTION





As we showed in earlier programs, you can use the PRINT function to
instruct the program to print the value of a variable in the OUTPUT
region.  The PRINT function can also be used to instruct the program to
print words on the display.  Words to be displayed must be enclosed in
quotation marks (").  Set the SPEED at 8 and input the following
program:





1 Print "A"

2 Print "IS"

3 Print A

4 A!A+1

5 Clear

6 Goto 1






Now run the program and watch the OUTPUT region.  The program prints the
words you have inputted, but they are "stacked."





Let's change the program slightly by inputting a comma (,) at the end of
line 1 and line 2.  The program now looks like this:





1 Print "A"

2 Print "IS"

3 Print A

4 A!A+1

5 Clear

6 Goto 1






A IS 12





The comma (,) in line 1 has instructed the program that whatever is on
line 2 is to be displayed in the OUTPUT region on the same line as the
instruction on line 1.  The comma in line 2 has instructed the program
that the line 3 instruction is to follow line 2.  These instructions can
be shortened by changing the program to read:





1 Print "A","IS"

,A

2 A!A+1

3 Clear

4 Goto 1






A IS 15





The program can be further shortened:





1 Print "A IS", A

2 A!A+1

3 Clear

4 Goto 1






A IS 18





Writing the program in this fashion will also save some memory.





USING THE GRAPHICS REGION





The GRAPHICS region is the blue rectangular field on your television
screen.  At first glance it appears to contain one red square in the
upper left corner.  The red square actually covers a white square and
both may be moved independently on the field under your program control.





To move the squares you must change their coordinates.
The red square is object number 1.  Its horizontal coordinate is
represented on the Keyboard by Hor 1 and its vertical coordinate by Ver
1. Hor 2 and Ver 2 are the coordinates of object number 2, the white
square.





Both objects or squares start out in the upper left corner of the blue
field, with only the red square showing.  The upper left corner is the
zero (0) position or origin.  When the variables Hor 1, Ver 1, Hor 2 and
Ver 2 are not defined (given values) they have values of 0 (therefore
causing the squares to remain in the upper left corner position).





When a coordinate is assigned a value other than 0, (e.g. Hor 1!10), the
object involved will jump to the corresponding position on the blue
field when the program is executed.





Input the following program:





1 Hor 1!Hor 1+1

2 Goto 1

Hor 1 is 17






This program will move the red square to the right, one horizontal space
at a time.  Run this program and you will see the red square moving
slowly to the right.  Check the VARIABLES region and you will see the
value of Hor 1 increasing.  It will increase until it reaches 99, the
largest number allowed, and then drop back to 0.  When Hor 1 reaches 99,
the red square will have reached the far right side of the blue field.
At this point, the red square "wraps around" and starts again from the
far left side of the field, with Hor 1 at 0.





The horizontal coordinates (Hor 1 and Hor 2) then, range from 0 to 99.
The vertical coordinates (Ver 1 and Ver 2) also range from 0 to 99, with
0 being the position at the top of the blue field, and 99 being the
position at the bottom.





Input the following program:





1 Hor 1!Hor 1+6

2 Ver 1!Ver 1+8

3 Hor 2!Hor 2+4

4 Ver 2!Ver 2+4

5 If Hit Then Note!2

Else Note!7

6 Goto 1






Remove the program from the screen and make sure the GRAPHICS region is
fully visible.  Set the speed at 60 and run the program.  This program
shows you one way to move the squares on the field.  It also reveals how
the HIT and ELSE functions may be put to use.





In line 5 the program is instructing the computer to sound the 2 note IF
the squares HIT, which they do periodically.  To HIT means the squares
must occupy the same coordinates.  Otherwise (ELSE) the computer is
instructed to play the 7 note, which it will do until the squares hit.





(Remove ELSE NOTE!7 from line 5 and note 2 will be played when the
squares hit and no other note will be sounded.)





USING THE MOD FUNCTION





Mod is an arithmetic operator, much like the division operator (/).
BASIC PROGRAMMING employs integer division, which means it works with
whole numbers only, and leaves no remainder.  For example, what is 14/5?
You might say 2 and 4/5, or 2, remainder 4.  In BASIC PROGRAMMING 14/5
is 2.  Although 5 divides into 14 twice (making 10), with 4 left over,
BASIC uses whole numbers only, so the answer it gives you is 2.





The computer will give you the same answer for 12/4 as it will for 13/4.
The answer in both instances is 3, since 4 will divide into both 12 and
13, 3 whole times.  The computer will not recognize the remainder of 1
in the case of 13/4.





Now for the Mod function.  Mod gets the remainder left over after
dividing the first number into the second number.  So, 14 Mod 5 is 4.
Five divides into 14 twice (making 10) with 4 left over.  Mod gets the
remainder left over, therefore Mod is 4.





What is 13 Mod 4?  The answer is 1 since 1 is left over after dividing 4
into 13 (which makes 12).  How about 12 Mod 4?  In this case, Mod is 0
since 4 divides into 12 evenly with nothing or 0 remaining.





Normally, dividing by 0 is undefined, mathematically speaking.  In BASIC
PROGRAMMING, dividing by 0 just gives a result of 0, so that 5/0 is 0.





Operator Priorities





In an equation, the arithmetic operators (+, -, x, /, Mod, etc.) are
worked out in order of an established priority.
BASIC PROGRAMMING uses the following operator priority guide:





1. x / (Highest)

2. + -

3. Mod

4. =

5. ! (Lowest)






Using Parenthesis





Using parenthesis (green mode, left side of Keyboard), gives priority to
whichever numbers the parenthesis surround when working out an equation.





For example, when working out the following equation:





A   5+3x2 Mod 7





the first step is:  3x2=6

the second step is:  5+6=11

the third step is: 11 Mod 7=4

A=4






However, the same equation with parenthesis inserted, is worked out
differently and gives a different answer for A.





A   (5+3)x2 Mod 7





first step:  5+3=8

second step:  8x2=16

third step:  16 Mod 7=2

A=2






SAMPLE PROGRAMS





Here are some sample programs.  They will help you see the wide range of
possibilities you have to work with.  Remember to pay close attention to
how a particular command (IF, THEN, HIT, ELSE, PRINT, KEY, etc.) affects
a program.  Remember too that a KEY command may depend on your input
from the right side of the Keyboard for successful operation of the
program.





Whenever a particular program confuses you, stop the program, reset it
to the beginning, and STEP through it.  By watching the program in the
STACK region and seeing how the computer works out each step, you should
be able to understand what is happening and why it is happening.





After running the programs and becoming familiar with the fundamentals
of computer programming in general, you'll be well on your way toward
writing some programs of your own.
