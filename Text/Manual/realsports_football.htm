1. INTRODUCTION

You're the quarterback of the ATARI offensive team, and you're really feeling
the pressure.  Down by less than a touchdown in the closing seconds of the
game, you have to maneuver that ball into the end zone somehow for the winning
score.  How will you do it?

You could run with the ball and try to evade that wide-ranging middle 
linebacker.  Be careful, though.  He's a littel bit faster than you and will
catch you over the distance. 

Fortunately, you've done your homework by practicing your passing in the
one-player game against the computer.  But this is head-to-head competition
against a real person, and people aren't always as predictable.

It's your ball.  Hurry!  Time's running out.  Can you call the right play and
get that touchdown?

2. GAME PLAY

The basic rules of football apply, with some modification.

Like regular football, the object of ATARI RealSports FOOTBALL is to score
more points than your opponent by getting touchdowns, field goals, and
safeties.  You advance the ball toward the goal by running and passing
according to the plays you select with your Joystick Controller.

Each team has five players, one of which can be controlled by the Joystick.
You can play against the computer in a one-person game; or you can compete
against another person in a two-player game.

The clock runs continuously during plays.  It stops after incompleted passes,
scores, turnovers, dead balls, and when offense calls its play.  It resumes
at the hike.

The clock will run down for no more than 30 seconds after the last completed
play.  If offense has not called its play by this time, the clock will
freeze until it resumes at the hike.

There are no time outs, no fumbles, no penalties, and no running out-of-bounds.
Each game consists of one 15-minute quarter.

3. USING THE CONTROLLERS

Use your Joystick Controllers with this ATARI Game Program cartridge.  Be sure
the controller cables are firmly plugged into the CONTROLLER jacks at the
back of your ATARI 2600 Video Computer System game.  For one-player games,
use the Joystick plugged into the LEFT CONTROLLER jack.  Hold the Joystick with
the red button to your upper left, toward the television screen. (See your
Owner's Manual for further details.)

Use your joystick to:

     * Call plays before the hike.
     * Direct your control-player after the hike.

Use the fire button to:

     * Hike the ball.
     * Pass the ball.
     * Program a kick play.
     * Kick the ball.
     * Call up a blitz play.

4. CONSOLE CONTROLS

GAME SELECT SWITCH

You can choose a one-player or a two-player game.  Press the GAME SELECT switch
until your choice is indicated by the down number on the scoreboard.

GAME RESET SWITCH

After you have selected your game, press the GAME RESET switch to begin a new
game.

TV TYPE SWITCH

Set this switch to COLOR if you're playing on a color television set.  Set it
to B-W to play the game in black and white.

DIFFICULTY SWITCHES

The difficulty switches establish the running speed of the control-players.
The A (advanced) switch makes the control-player run half as fast as the B
(beginner) switch.  The difficulty switches are especially useful as a
handicap so the abilities of two players can be more evenly matched.  B is the
recommended mode for all players.  A should be used as a handicap between
unevenly matched players--with the(allegedly) stronger player in the A mode.

5. CALLING PLAYS

In the one-player game, you play the blue team and the computer plays the
yellow team competively against you.  Sometimes you are on offense; sometimes
on defense.  In either case, you only have to call up the play for your side:
the computer will select its own play and hike the ball soon after.

In the two-player game, each person must select a play before the scrimmage
can begin.  The flashing scoreboard indicates which side has yet to call its
play.  As soon as both sides have called their plays, the flashing team scores
will stabilize, indicating that offense can now hike the ball by pressing the
red button.

To call plays, move the joystick or push the red button--as indicated by 
Figures 2 and 3.

OFFENSE

To pass, press the red button and the ball will be thrown toward a pass
pass-eligible receiver who is running a pre-arranged pattern.  You can only
have one pass-eligible receiver in any play.  The art of passing is to time
his pattern with the arrival of the ball. (Figure 2.)

To kick, you need to press the red button a total of three times.  once, to
program a kick play before the hike; a second time to hike the ball; a third
time to actually kick the ball.  Field goals and punts are called up in
exactly the same way.

If you kick close to the goal and the ball goes through the goal posts, the
kick will register as a field goal.  If the ball misses the goal posts, the
kick will have functioned as a punt.  The ball will be downed where it went 
dead; or, if it did enter the end zone, it will come out to the twenty for the
next set of plays.  There are no punt returns and no blocked kicks.

     Figure 2 - Offensive Plays

DEFENSE

Except for the blitz, each of the other four defensive plays offers some kind
of defense against a pass. (Figure 3.)

If you call a blitz, the defensive safeties will join the linemen in rushing
the quarterback.  You then have only your control-player to cover the pass
and a possible run.

6. SCORING

Crossing the defensive team's goal line by running or passing the ball
successfully into their end zone is a TOUCHDOWN.  It counts for seven (7)
points, and the ball will automatically be brought out to the twenty-yard line
to begin the next series of plays.

Kicking the ball through the &quot;goal posts&quot; is a FIELD GOAL and counts for three
(3) points, with the ball brought out to the twenty.  Kicking field goals is
random and depends on your proximity to the goal line.  If you kick from within
the twenty, your chances are excellent; if you're beyond the forty, better
try something else.

Tackling the ball carrier in his own end zone is a SAFETY and scores two (2)
points for the defensive team.  They also gain possession of the ball on their
own twenty-yaerd line.

7. HELPFUL HINTS

* When you call plays like the short pass left and the long pass left, it is
sometimes tricky to move your Joystick perfectly along the diagonal line that
programs those plays.  Try moving your Joystick straight up (or down) first,
and then shift it toward the diagonal that programs your selected play.

* After you throw a pass and thet quarterback has exited from the TV screen,
Joystick control is automatically transferred to the intended receiver.  Use
the Joystick to adjust his position while the ball is in mid-flight, and you
may improve your chances of completing a pass.

* &quot;Rolling out&quot; toward the side where your receiver runs his pattern is often
a good tactic in completing a pass.  Ultimately, though, successful passing
is a matter of good timing.

* Blocked passes and interceptions can occur if a defensive player is in the
direct line of flight of the pass.  You cannot throw a pass over a player's
head.

* It is not easy to run against the computer in the one-player game.  Your best
bet is to use your blockers and tangle up that fleet-footed linebacker at the
line while you scurry for yardage.

* The defensive control-player is a hair faster than the ball carrier, so he
can make the tackle over the short run.  But if you can manage to get a decent
enough headstart, you've got yourself a long gainer and maybe a touchdown.
