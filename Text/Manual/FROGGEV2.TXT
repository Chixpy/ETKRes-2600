	Leapin' Frogger!  Home may look like it's only a hop, skip, and a jump
	away, but looks can be deceiving.  First, there's a dangerous highway 
	to hop across, full of fast-moving cars and trucks.  Then there's a
	swirling river to leap, full of frog-eating creatures.  How's Frogger
	going to get home safely?  By letting you hop him on his way.  Guide 
	Frogger safely through this perilous journey, and you'll jump for joy!

OBJECT
------
	The object of the game is to hop as many frogs to safety as you can -
	and to score the most points along the way!

SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS
----------------------------
	1. To select a game number (see Game Selection Box), press down on the
	   GAME SELECT switch.  The game number will appear at the top of the 
	   screen.

	2. Set the DIFFICULTY switch:
	   Position A:
	   You'll lose Frogger if he's carried off-screen on a floating object.
	   Position B:
	   Frogger can be carried safely off-screen on a floating object. 
	   He'll then reappear on the other side of the screen so you can 
	   continue play.  However, Frogger can't hop off-screen.

	   In a one-player game, use the left DIFFICULTY switch.  In a
	   two-player game, the 1st player uses the left DIFFICULTY switch and 
	   the 2nd player uses the right DIFFICULTY switch.

	3. Press down the GAME RESET switch - and you're ready to start the
	   action!

THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLERS
------------------------
	Make sure you plug the Joystick controllers firmly into the jacks at
	the back of your video system.  Use the LEFT controller jack for 
	one-player games.  

	Use the Joystick to jump Frogger forwards, backward, left, and right.
	In games 1-4, move the Joystick "once" in the direction you wish 
	Frogger to jump.  Frogger will make "one jump" in that direction.  You
	"must" do this each time you want Frogger to make one jump.  In games 
	5 and 6, Frogger becomes "Speedy" Frogger!  As long as you hold the 
	Joystick in one direction, Speedy Frogger will jump again and again in
	that direction.

PLAYING
-------
	This illustration shows the journey Frogger has to make - from sidewalk
	to home bay:

	[picture of game screen (mention of the other six pictures is omitted as
	they are all virtually the same)  The picture shows the "Home Bays" to 
	be five blue squares at the top of the screen which are extensions of 
	the river.  The river follows filled with five rows of brown logs and 
	blue and red circles representing turtles.  The "Riverbank" is then in 
	the middle of the screen shown to be yellow, follow by the black road 
	filled five rows of automobiles. The "Sidewalk" is next similar to the
	riverbank.  The green Frogger is shown to be on the sidewalk.  The 
	"Time Band" is represented by a black band at the bottom right of the 
	screen, while your "Remaining Frogs" are represented by white dots on 
	the bottom left.]

	You'll start the game with 5 frogs.  The first frog is shown on the
	sidewalk below the traffic.  The remaining frogs are shown as white 
	squares on the lower left-hand corner of the screen.

TIME BAND
---------
	You have only 30 seconds to move Frogger from the sidewalk and into a
	home bay, one of the blue, open-ended squares squares at the top of the
	screen.

	Time is monitored by the time band, the black line located in the lower
	right-hand corner of the screen When you have only 5 seconds left to get
	Frogger into a home bay, you'll hear a warning sound and see the line 
	turn red.

	If you run out of time before you get Frogger home, you'll lose him. 
	When this happens, you'll hear a "sploosh" sound and see a green "X" 
	where Frogger was when his time ran out.

FROM SIDEWALK TO RIVERBANK
--------------------------
	Frogger starts his perilous journey on the sidewalk, facing 5 lanes of
	cars and trucks.  When the music stops, you're ready to start Frogger 
	hopping!

	Try to get Frogger through the lanes of traffic.  Traffic travels in
	alternative directions and at different speeds, so be careful!  Frogger
	will get "splooched" if he touches any part of a vehicle or is run over.

FROM RIVERBANK TO RIVER
-----------------------
	Because Frogger can't swim in the river (the current is too strong),
	hop him from one row of logs, turtles, or alligators onto the next in 
	order to cross it.

	1. Logs: Frogger can hop from side to side on a log; he can also jump
	   forward and backward onto another floating object.  But he'll land
	   in the river if he leaps to the left or right off a log.

	2. Turtles: The red circles that float on the river are the turtles. 
	   Frogger is safe on their backs as well as in the water area between
	   a set of them (2 or 3 turtles in a row).  He can jump forward and 
	   backward from a turtle onto another floating object.  But he'll land
 	   in the river if he jumps to the left or right off either of the end 
	   turtles.

	3. Diving Turtles: These tricky turtles can float on the water and dive
	   under the water!  When they're red, it's safe for Frogger to jump on
	   their backs.  But once they turn light blue, watch out!  That means 
	   they're getting ready to dive, so hop Frogger onto another floating 
	   object fast!  If you're not quick enough, Frogger will get 
	   "splooshed."

	   But these turtles can't stay under water forever.  When you see a
	   set of light blue turtles suddenly appear on the screen, this means 
	   they're coming up for air.  They'll soon be changing from light blue
	   to red, so Frogger will be safe on their backs until they they dive 
	   again.

	While crossing the river, here are some other things to watch for:

	1. Lady Frog: Occasionally you'll see a white "lady" frog hopping
	   frantically along a log.  If you hop Frogger onto the log to rescue 
	   her and take her home, you'll score bonus points.  Just hop Frogger 
	   close enough to her so she'll jump onto his back.  You'll hear a 
	   high-pitched sound when she does.  Now, try to get Frogger - and 
	   the lady frog - home to safety.

	2. Alligators: Alligators swim among the logs from time to time. 
	   You'll see them snapping their jaws open and closed, just waiting 
	   for a tender Frogger morsel to jump their way!  Frogger is safe on 
	   an alligator's tail and back.  But Frogger is a goner if he jumps 
	   into its jaws!

	3. Floating Off-Screen: Frogger gets "splooched" in DIFFICULTY Position
	   A if he's carried off-screen on a log, turtle, or alligator.  This 
	   doesn't happen in DIFFICULTLY Position B.

	4. Snakes: Snakes will appear on the riverbank and logs as the game
	   gets more difficult.  You can hop Frogger onto a snake's back, but 
	   he'll get "splooshed" if he hops too close to a snake's mouth.

FROM RIVER TO HOME BAY
----------------------
	Successfully hop Frogger into a home bay, and he's safe and sound! 
	You'll score points each time you bring Frogger home, and get bonus 
	points each time you bring 5 froggers home!

	When leaping Frogger into its home bay, here are some things to watch
	for: 

	1. Jumping Home: Hop Frogger into a home bay when he's directly in
	   front of it.  If Frogger hits any part of the green shrubbery on 
	   the sides of the home bay, he'll land in the river

	2. Occupied Home Bay: Frogger can't jump into a home bay that's
	   occupied by another frog.

	3. Alligator's Head: If an alligator's head is showing in a home bay,
	   it's not safe for Frogger to jump in.  However, if the head is just 
	   beginning to surface, Frogger won't be harmed.

	4. Fly: If you hop Frogger into a home bay while a fly is showing,
	   Frogger gets a free meal - and you score extra points!

GAME DIFFICULTLY
----------------
	Each time you bring 5 frogs home, you'll hear a short tune.  Then the
	game will continue at a more difficult level with your remaining frogs.
	The traffic will be more difficult to cross.  There will be fewer 
	floating objects on the river, and the speed of these floating objects
	will vary fast to slow.  Frogger-eating snakes will also appear on the
	riverbank and, in progressively more difficult levels, on the logs.

END OF GAME
-----------
	The game ends when no frogs are left.

	To Play Again: In a one-player game, press the red button on your
	Joystick to play again at the same game number.  In a two-player game,
	both players press the red buttons at the same time to play again at 
	the same game number.  To play at another game number, use the GAME 
	SELECT switch.

	Frogger has 6 game variations.  Games 1, 3, and 5 are one-player games;

	number variations.

	Two-Player Games: Games 2, 4, and 6 are two-player games.  The left
	player goes first; players then alternate turns.  Your turn ends when 
	you lose a frog; you begin your turn again with your remaining frogs. 
	Each player's score is displayed throughout his or her turn at the top

	frogs.
