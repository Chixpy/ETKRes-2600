How to Supercharge your Video Game System

[Pages have a picutre of a TV with CMFS on the screen, an Atari 2600 with
a Supercharger attached, an extremely old looking cassette player, and 2
Atari 2600 Joysticks.  Apart from the connecting cable between the 2600
and the cassette player, the normal rat's nest of cables that this setup would
involve are not to be seen.  There is also a picture of Supercharger on
the same page, with a label that does not have any of the Starpath stuff
on it.]

* Set up your Atari(R) Video Computer System(TM) (or just about any game
system that takes Video Computer System(TM) game cartridges) according to
manufacturer instructions.

* Make sure the power switch is OFF, and insert the Arcadia(TM) 
Supercharger(TM) with label up.  Be careful not to force it or insert
crookedly.

* Connect the plug on the end of the Supercharger(TM) cable to the earphone
jack of any cassette recorder/player.  The earphone jack may also be
labeled "monitor," "mon.," "ear," or "output."*
   * If you use a large cassette deck with a "phone" type earphone plug, you
     may purchase an adaptor at most electronics specialty stores.

* Turn the power switch of the game system ON.  The TV screen should read
"REWIND TAPE, PRESS PLAY."  If not, turn the power off and check to make sure
the system is properly hooked up and the Supercharger(TM) fully inserted.

* Insert the COMMUNIST MUTANTS FROM SPACE(TM) cassette, label side up, into
the cassette player.  Turn the volume and tone controls about halfway up.

* Press REWIND and wait until the tape stops moving.  Now press PLAY.

* In a few moments, you will hear the sounds of the game loading and see
colored panels fill the screen.  A moment later "STOP TAPE" will appear,
and you'll be ready to play COMMUNIST MUTANTS FROM SPACE.(TM)

If you have trouble...
* If the tape player makes a screeching noise, you have not plugged the
Supercharger(TM) cable into the "earphone" jack.

* If the tape doesn't move, the batteries in the cassette player may be
too weak.

* You may have forgotten to rewind the tape completely.

* If everything else seems OK, try turning up the TONE and VOLUME controls
on the cassette player.  If the screen remains unchanged, remove the cassette,
turn it over (label side down), rewind it, and press PLAY.

Communist Mutants from Space (TM)

Your mission: Vaporize the mutant warriors before they overrun your home
planet.

About the enemy: The evil ruler of the planet Rooskee has launched a diabolical
attack.  A cunning Mother Creature, filled with irradiated vodka, transforms
helpless slaves captured on peaceful planets into bloodthirsty COMMUNIST
MUTANTS.
   The Commie Mutants attack like crazy!  Wipe out wave after wave of them,
and they keep on coming.  And the more you vaporize, the nastier they get.
You've got trouble.

Game Options
Press GAME SELECT and your options "menu" will appear on the screen.  You
can customize your own variation of COMMUNIST MUTANTS FROM SPACE(TM) by
choosing options from the menu.
   Move the joystick up or down to place the highlight over the feature you
wish to select.  Move the joystick right or left, or push the "fire" button,
to select options and number of players.

Note: if you leave the "menu" on the screen for a few moments, the game will
begin "self play."  You'll see the game play by itself, and you'll see the 
current high score displayed.  To get back to the "menu," simply tug on the
joystick or press GAME SELECT

PLAY    Starts the game action.
PL 1    Selects the number of players (1 to 4)
DIF 1   Selects the difficulty level (1 = easy to 9 = hard)
SH NO   Allows you to activate SHIELDS during the game.
TW NO   Allows you to activate TIME WARP during the game.
PF NO   Gives you PENETRATING FIRE
GF NO   Gives you GUIDED FIRE

[Screen shot shows options menu screen]

The Mutant Attack

As soon as play begins, you'll be under attack.  The Mother Creature will
constantly try to create more COMMUNIST MUTANT attackers.  The attackers
start as mutant eggs and soon hatch into nasty creatures.
   Some of the mutant eggs appear not to hatch.  Don't be fooled.  They
are actually shield-penetrating bombs in disguise

[Screen shot shows CMFS being played]

   You begin with a small reserve of anti-mutant cannons.  Each time the
mutants destroy one of your cannons, a reserve is called up.  When the last
cannon is destroyed, the game is over.  You can, however, earn bonus cannons
after every other wave of mutant attacks.
   You'll never run out of ammunition, so keep shooting.  Your cannons destroy
Communist Mutants, Mutant Bombs, and the Mother Creature itself.

Scoring
* Point Values
[Wretched black block diagrams of items accompany this chart.  I'm not going
to reproduce them.]

Mother Creature                   500 Points
Diving Mutant Attackers            60 Points
Mutant Eggs                        10 Points
Clearing the screen of Mutant
Attackers (earns a "flag")        100 Points

of each game.

Game Variations

Difficulty Levels.  Start with level 1 (relatively mild mutants) and work
your way up to level 9 (really mean mutants).

Maneuverability.  Control the speed of your anti-mutant cannon with the
difficulty switchs.  "A" makes it slow.  "B" makes it fast.  The left
difficulty switch is shared by players one and three.  The right switch by
players two and four.

Shields.  Shields are activated by pulling back on the joystick.  You can use
your shields only once, until a new wave of mutant attacks, or a cannon
appears.

Time Warp.  Slow down the mutant attack with time warp.  Activate it by
pushing forward on the joystick.  But you can use the feature only once,
until a new wave of mutant attacks, or a cannon appears.

Penetrating Fire.  This feature permits your cannon fire to blast through
one mutant and wipe out the next in line.

Guided Fire.  This feature permits you to steer your cannon fire with the
joystick.

Multi-Player Games.  Players one and three share the left joystick.  Players
two and four share the right joystick.  The number in the lower left corner
of the screen indicates which player is "up."

Controls

* Game Select switch calls the "menu" to the screen.

* Difficulty switches affect the horizontal speed of your cannon.

* Game Reset switch starts a new game instantly.
