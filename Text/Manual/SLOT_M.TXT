Use your Joystick Controllers with this Game Program(TM).
Be sure the controllers are firmly connected to your
Video Computer System(TM).  See section 3 of your owner's
manual for details.  Hold the controller with the red
button to your upper left towards the television screen.
For one-player games use the right controller.

Note: The console unit should be off when inserting or
removing a Game Program.  This will protect the electronic
components and prolong the life of your Atari(R) Video
Computer System.

HOW TO PLAY

Depress the console's game select switch to choose the
particular Slot machine you wish to play.  Each "Machine
Playfield" features a specific number of players and
"paylines."  (See matrix on back cover for the game
number of each variation.)  The game number appears in
the upper left corner of the Machine Playfield.  The
first number in the upper right corner refers to the
number of players; the second number refers to the
number of paylines.

Depress the game reset switch to start play.  The numbers
in the upper right and left corners change to 25 in games
2, 4, 6, and 8, which are two-player games.  This is the
number of coins each player receives in their "bank" to
begin betting.  In games 1, 3, 5, and 7, which are one-
player games, the number in the upper left corner changes
to 24.

This occurs because the computer has made its initial bet
and subtracted one coin from the original 25-coin bank.

The numbers in each lower corner of the Machine Playfield
show how much is being "bet" by each player.  A question
mark appears in each player's betting square.

The Difficulty Switches have no effect in this Game Program.

HOW TO BET

Use the red button on your Joystick Controller to place your
bet.  You can bet up to five coins each time.  Games 3, 4,
7, and 8 have a maximum of five paylines.  Each bet of one
coin increases the chances of adding to your bank.  For
example, bet three coins and you may win a jackpot on
either the first, second, or third paylines.

Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 only "pay" on the center line (or
payline ).  In these games, the more you bet (up to five
coins) the more you can add to your bank.

After placing your bet, pull back on your Joystick to spin
the reels of the Slot Machine.  In two-player games, both
players must do this to spin the reels.  The game ends
when one player's bank is "broke".  To continue play depress
the game reset switch once.  This adds 25 coins to each
player's bank.  (The game may end with one player going
broke, while the other player has coins remaining.  When
the game reset switch is depressed once, the player who
went broke is given 25 coins, while the player with coins
remaining receives 25 coins plus the amount left when the
game ended.)

In one-player games, you are competing against the computer.
The computer makes a random bet for each play.  The game
ends if you or the computer go broke.  To continue play
depress the game reset switch once.  This adds 25 coins to
each bank.  As in two-player games, the player with coins
remaining when the game ends does not lose those coins when
the game reset switch is depressed once those coins when the
game reset switch is depressed once.

Depress the game reset switch TWICE to reset each player's
bank to 25 coins, for all one- and two-player games.

SCORING

Your Slot Machine(TM) Game Program "pays off" in the same
manner as a 3-wheel, 20-stop, slot machine found in a
gambling casino.

The score for a one-player game is displayed in the upper
right corner of the screen.  The computer's score is on
the left.  In two-player games, the right player's score
is on the right, the left player's score is on the left.
