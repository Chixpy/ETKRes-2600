                Mysterious Dissappearances!

                Authorities Baffled

_HAUNTED DUNGEONS, U.S.A._

Over the past few weeks, several professional treasure hunters have
dissappeared while exploring a dungeon reputed to house the most priceless
treasures in the world. The only known survivor has returned with stories
of monsters who eliminate anyone who dares enter the dungeon's halls and
complex labyrinth of chambers. But authorities are not taking such reports
seriously.

&quot;We have no rational explanation for these dissappearances,&quot; one
investigator reported. &quot;All we know is that the brave soul who wants to
claim those treasures had better be sharp. At this point, the only one I
know who's clever enough for the job is Winky(TM),&quot; he told a crowd of
would-be hunters. &quot;Our hero should be ready with bow and arrows. Whoever
or whatever is guarding those treasures is determined that no one come[s]
out of there alive.&quot;


                Getting Started

1. With your TV turned on, insert the Venture cartridge into your
   Atari 2600 (or 7800TM) as explained in your Owner's Manual, and
   turn on your console. A dungeon made up of hallways and four
   chambers appears on the screen, guarded by roaming Hallmonsters(TM).
   Winky is a small dot at the bottom of the screen.

2. Plug a joystick into the left joystick port.

3. If your are using an Atari 2600, select either color or black and
   white with the TV switch.

4. Set the Left and Right Difficulty switches to select a skill level
   from 1 to 4. (Level 1 is the easiest and 4 the most difficult.)

   Skill          Switch
   Level          Setting
     1         left B/right B
     2         left B/right A
     3         left A/right B
     4         left A/right A

5. Press _[Reset]_ to start the game or to begin a new game.


                Playing the Game

Hold the joystick so that the fire button is on the top-left corner

Move the joystick handle left, right, up, or down to make Winky run.

Position the joystick handle in the direction you want Winky to
shoot an arrow. Then press the fire button.

You'll begin your venture in the first hall of chambers. Each chamber
houses one treasure, guarded by herd of horrible and dangerous monsters.
Your goal is to capture the treasure in every chamber. To do so, you
must get past the Hallmonsters, enter each chamber, and capture the
treasure. The order for entering the chambers is up to you. But once
you grab a treasure from a chamber, you're locked out of that chamber
for good.

Capturing the treasure is no easy task. Once you enter a chamber, you
must be alert. While you're running for the treasure, the monsters
inside the chamber are running after you. You can stop them by
killing them with your arrows. But grab the treasure first, then shoot
them, to win points. If you run into a chamber monster, dead or alive,
you'll lose a Winky.

As if this weren't enough to worry about, those pesky Hallmonsters are
gettinng impatient. If you stay inside a chamber too long, they'll come
in to get you. You cannot shoot Hallmonsters, however. The only way to
protect yourself is to run from them. If they get you, you'll lose a
Winky.

The trickiest chamber of all is the Wall Room. Here you can reach the
treasure only by careful timing. Unfortunately for you, you can't shoot
the moving, electrified walls.

If you capture the treasure in every chamber, you'll descend to a new
hall of chambers, even more horrible and dangerous than the previous
one.

Remember that Winky has three backups to help out in case he runs into
trouble. The game is over if you use up all four of the Winkies.
