PREPARE FOR BATTLE
	Your assignment?  Simple.  Annihilate the enemy.  Diminish their 
	manpower.  Destroy their vehicles.  And  detonate their mega-fortress. 
	Sounds tough?  Well, just wait.  It gets worse.  Because you have to
	carry out the entire mission SINGLE-HANDED!

GEARING UP
	1. Make sure the power switch on your game system is OFF.
	2. Insert the COMMANDO cartridge as described in your gamesystem
	   manual.
	3. Turn the power switch ON.

	For 1 player: Press the RESET lever to begin play.
	For 2 players: Press the GAME SELECT lever, then the 
	RESET lever to begin play.

WHAT'S WHAT ON THE BIG SCREEN
	Your score is shown at the top of the screen.  At the bottom, from left
	to right, the screen shows you how many grenades you have left, how 
	many lives you have left, and the level you're currently playing.

YOUR ARTILLERY
	You have two weapons: a rapid-fire machine gun and grenades.

	MACHINE GUN
	You'll have unlimited firing capacity with this baby.  And you can
	shoot in eight different directions.

	Aim the joystick in the direction you want to shoot and press the
	joystick button.

	GRENADES
	You start out with three.  But you can easily pick up more.  Every time
	you PASS OVER the two grenade boxes, you'll acquire four more grenades. 
	So don't pass those things up without passing over them.

	To toss a grenade, HOLD DOWN the joystick button.  The grenade will
	always move directly up-screen from wherever you toss it.

MOVING THROUGH ENEMY TERRITORY
	You can move in eight different directions:

				Forward
	    Upper Left Diagonal    |    Upper Right Diagonal
	                       \   |   /
				-------
				|     |
		       Left <-- |  O  | --> Right
			        |     |
			        -------
	                       /   |   \
	    Lower Left Diagonal    |    Lower Right Diagonal
				Backward

	WHAT'S OUT THERE...
	There are many things to look for out there in enemy territory.  Some
	more dangerous than others.  And most worth valuable points.

	Here are some of the obstacles you'll find - and some tips on what to
	do about them:

		THE ENEMY	Off them
		PALM TREES	Blast them or use them as cover
		BRIDGES		Go under them
		BARRICADES	Go around them
		GRENADE BOXES	Go "over" them
		FOX HOLES	Avoid them

	THE MEGA-FORTRESS
	At the end of each level (there are eight levels in all), you'll see a
	giant fortress of a building.  After you've killed a given number of
	fortress guards, you'll be allowed to enter the building.

	Go through the fortress door as quickly as you can.  Once you do,
	you'll automatically destroy the fortress and go on to the next level.

	Once you've completed all eight levels, you'll start back at level 1. 
	But don't be fooled.  It may "look" the same.  But it certainly won't 
	"play" the same.  Because every round gets tougher, faster, and much
	more intense.

LIVES AND MORE LIVES
	You start out with three lives.  And for every 10,000 points you earn,
	you'll receive another life.

	KEEPING SCORE
	Here's how you'll earn your points:
	  Enemy (shot with machine gun)		200 points
	  Enemy (knocked out with grenade)	500
	  Blowing up a tree			500
	  Crossing over grenade boxes	      1,000
