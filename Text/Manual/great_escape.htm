RULES<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
When moving the joystick only<br>
(i) Move forward<br>
The background will move down showing<br>
that the ship is moving forward.<br>
(ii) Move backward<br>
The background will move up showing <br>
that the ship is moving backward.<br>
(iii) Move to left<br>
The background will move to the right.<br>
(iv) Move to right<br>
The background will move to the left.<br>
<br>
* The space ship is always at the centre.<br>
<br>
When the push button is pressed while joystick is:<br>
(i) Move forward<br>
The ship fires at the forward direction.<br>
(ii) Moved backward<br>
The ship fires at the backward direction.<br>
(iii) Moved to left<br>
The ship fires at the left side.<br>
(iv) Moved to right<br>
The ship fires at the right side.<br>
<br>
During firing, the speed of the ship follows the regulation as stated<br>
in the last paragraph, ie automatically increases in speed.<br>
(1) The speed of the space ship will continue to increase in the<br>
direction under your control for a period of 4 sec eventhough<br>
it has been altered.<br>
(2) The speed of the space ship will increase if you press the<br>
joystick towards the direction of it's travelling course ahead.<br>
(3) The speed of the space ship will decrease if you press the joystick<br>
in the direction opposite to it's course.<br>
(4) The speed of the space ship will never decrease to zero except in<br>
the transition state, ie. from forward to backward, from left to<br>
right.<br>
(5) You cannot change in direction at right angle to the present <br>
course of the ship unless you have decelerated to the lowest speed.<br>
(6) The wide angle scanner shows you only the Alien and Super Alien,<br>
and is the true picture of what happens. It is because the Alien<br>
is very tricky and may imitate as a Meteorite or it hide behind<br>
the Meteorite.<br>
(7) The space ship should always be aware of the Super Alien and try<br>
to avoid meeting it. Whenever it appears on the short range<br>
scanner, the space ship would be destroye and no way to escape.<br>
(8) A Bonus space ship will be awarded for every 10,000 marks<br>
scored with a maximum of 3 ships to be awarded.<br>
<br>
[HINT:- If you hear the warning sound of an approaching Super Alien then<br>
glance immediately at your Long Range Scanner to see where it is in<br>
relation to your Space Ship, then FLEE!]<br>
