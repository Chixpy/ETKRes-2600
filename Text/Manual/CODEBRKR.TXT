                      CODE BREAKER

1. Using the Controllers
  Use your Keyboard Controllers with this ATARI Game Program cartridge. 
Be sure to plug the controller cables fimrly into the CONTROLLER jacks at
the back of your ATARI Video Computer System.
  For 1-player games use the Keyboard Controller plugged into the LEFT
CONTROLLER jack.  See Section 3 of your owner's manual for further details.

2. Console Controls
  Game Select:  Use this switch to select the game number you wish to
play.  The game number appears at the upper left corner of the screen. 
(See the GAME SELECT MATRIX for game numbers.)
  Game Reset:  Use this switch to start game play or to reset a game at
any time.  If the game number is on the screen when the game reset switch
is pressed, the game number will disappear to make room for the player's
scores.
  Difficulty Switches:  During Codebreaker games, when the right
difficulty witch is in the A position, you have 8 guesses.  In the B
position you have 12 guesses.  During 1-player NIM games, you can improve
the playing ability of the computer by sliding the right difficulty switch
to the A position.  The difficulty switches do not affect 2-plyaer NIM games.
  TV Type Switch:  Set this switch to color if you have a color television
set.  Set it to b-w if you are playing the game in black and white.

3. Game Play
  Codebreaker:
  The computer or another plyaer has created the secret code, and your
mission is to guess the code.  The code's identity is affect by:
* The number of digits. Games feature codes with 3 or 4 digits.
* The number span.  Games feature codes with numbers from 1 to 9, or 1 to 6.
You have 12 (or 8) guesses to identify the secret code with the Keyboard
Controller.  Use the controller to enter the number digits of your guess
onto the screen.  The computer will then analyze each number digit of your
code guess.
  One-player CODEBREAKER:  Use the left Keyboard Controller to play
1-player CODEBREAKER games.  To make a guess, press the number digits on
the Keyboard.  The press the enter (#) button.  The digits you have
entered will appear on the left side of the screen.  The computer will
then analyze your guess with computer symbols.
  Two-player CODEBREAKER:  A series of 2-player games begins with the
right controller player.  In CODEBREAKER games where a player must create
the secret code, press the digits of the secret code on the Keyboard
Controller.  Those digits appear in the upper left corner of the screen. 
Press the enter (#) button and the digits disappear.  Now your opponent
starts to make guesses using the same procedure as in 1-player games.
  To change a digit in your guess, move the cursor to the digit to be
changed.  Press the new number you want on the Keyboard Controller.  The
new number will appear in the position.
  NOTE: The computer will not accept a digit whose numberical value is
more than defined by a particular game.  For example, if the number span
of the scret code is between 1 and 6, the computer will not accept a
number 7.
  to play a consecutive game of CODEBREAKER, press any number of the
Keyboard to clear the screen.  To begin a new series of consecutive games
and scores, press Game Reset.
  Nim:
  NIM is the oldest nathematical game known to man.  In this computer
version of NIM, there are 1 to 4 stacks of objects.  You must take turns
with the computer or another player removing any number of objects from
nay stack.  During a turn you must take at least one object, and can take
objects out of only 1 stack.
  NOTE:  During a series of consecutive 2-player NIM games, you and your
opponent must take turns removing the first object.
  To start a new NIM game:  Press any key on the Keyboard Controller at
the conclusion of a game.  The setup form the previous NIM game will
appear on the screen.
  NOTE: In 1-player games, use the left Keyboard Controller.
  To remove objects from a particular NIM stack:  Press the Keyboard
Controller cursor (*) button to move the cursor on the screen.  The number
of times your press the button determines the stack where the cursor will
appear.  For example, press the button 3 times to move the cursor to stack 3.
After you have moved the cursor to the stack where you intend to remove
objects, press any number button on the Keyboard Controller, and that
number of objects will blink and then disappear form the stack.  When you
are satisfied with all the moves you've made at each stack, press the
enter (#) button.
  NOTE:  You may change your move any time before you press then enter (#)
button.  For example, after taking 3 objects from a stack, you may decide
to take only 2.  Move the cursor to the stack, then press number 2 on the
Keyboard Controller.  One object will reappear in the stack.
  To create a player setup:  Press the cursor (*) button to move the
cursor to a stack.  The number of times your press the button determines
the stack where the cursor will appear.  For example, press the curosr
button 3 times to move the cursor to stack 3.  Once the cursor is directly
over the particularlocation, select the nubmer of objects in each stack. 
Press a number button on the Keyboard.  The number button you press
determines the number of objects in the stack.  For example, press the
number 3 and 3 objects will appear in the stack.  When you have selected
objects for each stack, press the enter (#) button and the game begins.

4.  Game Variations
  Codebreaker:
  1-player Games:  The computer selects the secreat number code.  You have
12 (or 8) guesses to identify the code.  Your number of guesses equals
your point score.  for example, if you guess the secret code on the fourth
guess, you score 4 points.
  2-player Games:  There are 2 ways for 2 players to play CODEBREAKER:
  1.  The computer selects the secret number code.  You and your opponent
take turns making guesses.  In the first game of a series of consecutive
games, the right controller player always makes the first guess.  The
first player to match the secret number code scores 1 point and starts the
next game.
  2.  The player creates the secret number code using the Keyboard
Controller.  The opponent then tries to guess the secret code in the least
number of guesses.  When the opponent guesses the secret code, his score
is equal to the number of guesses.  For example, a player scores 4 points
when he guesses the secret code on the fourth guess.  During the next
game, the roles are reversed and the player who tried to guess the code
becomes the player who creates the secret code.
  NOTE:  Only the player who is guessing the secret code has a chance to
score points.  When playing a series of consecutive games, begin the first
game with the left controller player who tries to guess the secret code.
  Nim:
  There are 2 kinds of NIM games:
  1.  Regular NIM:  You win the game when you remove the last object from
the screen.
  2.  NIM Misere:  You lose the game when you remove the last object from
the screen.
  There are 2 kinds of NIM game setups:
  1.  Computer Setup:  Three stacks of objects appear on the screen.  One
stack has 3 objects.  The second stack has 4 objects, and the third
stack features 5 objects.
  2.  Player Setup:  Using the Keyboard Controller, aplayer can create a
NIM setup.  Create up to 4 stacks with up to 9 objects in each stack.

5. Scoring
  Codebreaker:
  1-player Games:  A player's score during 1 game is determined by the
number of guesses needed to identify the secret number code. For example,
if a player guesses the code on the sixth guess, the score is 6.  You
object is to score the lowest possibly score.  Your cumulative score
appears in the upper left corner of the screen at the end of the game. 
Hint:  In 1-player games, divide your socre by the number of  consecutive
games for an average score.
  2-player Games:  When the computer selects the secret code for both
players to guess, the player scores 1 point when he guesses the code. 
when one player creates the secret code, the object is to score the least
number of points.  for example, if a player guesses the secret code on
the fourth guess, he scores 4 points.
  Nim:
  A player scores 1 point when he wins a NIM game.  IN regular NIM games,
you score 1 point when you remove the last object from the screen.  In NIM
Misere games you score one point when you force your opponent to remove
the last object from the screen.  Scores will accumulate as you play
sonsecutive games of NIM.

6. Glossary
  Codebreaker:
  Left Score:  During CODEBREAKER games the upper left number refers to
the number of guesses players have made during the present game.  At the
end of the game, the left controller player's score appears in this position.
  Right Score:  In 1-plyaer CODEBREAKER games, this number appears
throughout the game to show the number of consecutive games of CODEBREAKER
you've played.  In 2-player games, this number refers to the right
controller player's score.
  Computer Secret Code:  The secret code will appear above the list of
player guesses at the end of the game.
  Player Guess:  The number code guess you enter into the computer appears
on the left side of the screen.
  Computer Symbols:  After you register your player guess with the
computer, the computer will respond with symobls that analyze your guess.
* Black Line:  Signifies that one of the number digits is the correct
identity and in the correct position.
* White Line:  Signifies that one of the number digits is the correct
identity but in the incorrect position.
  Cursor:  This flashing square appears in the position of the next number
entry into the computer.
  Player Indicators:  In 2-player games, the color of the line and its
position indicate whose Keyboard Controller must register the next guess. 
A white line appears on the far right of the playfield, meaning the right
controller player must enter a guess.  A black line appears to the left of
this position during the left controller player's turn.
  Nim:
  Stacks:  The stacks of objects appear on the left side of the screen.
  Cursor:  The cursor is used to remove objects from each stack.  Use the
Kayboard Controller to mvoe the cursor directly over the stack where you
want ot remove objects.
  Scores:  In 2-player games, the score of the left controller player is
in the upper left corner; the right controller player score is in the
upper right corner.  In 1-player games, your score is in the upper
left-corner; the computer's score is in the upper right corner.
