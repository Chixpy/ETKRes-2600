<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">You score points by destroying the alien ships with
your phaser weapon. See the score chart for the number of points awarded for each alien
ship in each of the 11 waves of alien attacks. The bonus gauge at the lower left of the TV
screen is worth 3200 points at the start of each wave. As the gauge moves, the number of
bonus points decreases. When all six aliens in a wave are destroyed the number of points
remaining in the bonus gauge is added to the score. The faster you are able to destroy all
six aliens in a wave the higher your bonus score will be. An additional bonus of 50 points
is awarded after each wave, even if the bonus gauge has reached zero. </font></p>

awarded an extra ship, up to a maximum of three. When your score reaches 40,000 points,
again, you will be awarded an extra ship. In addition, the aliens will use their guided
missiles regardless of the setting of the skill switches, making their attack more
challenging. </font></p>
