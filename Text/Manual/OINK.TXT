OINK! (TM) BASICS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. With power OFF, plug in the game cartridge.
2. Turn power ON.
3. Plug in Joystick Controller/s (solo player uses left Joystick).
4. Set both difficulty switches to 'b' to begin.
5. Select game with the game select switch.
   Game 1: One player (controlling the Pig) vs. Computer Wolf.
   Game 2: Two players (taking turns controlling the Pig) vs. Computer Wolf.
   Game 3: Two players (taking turns controlling the Pig and the Wolf).
6. The Joystick Controller.  Move your Joystick to the left to move your Pig
    to the left, to the right to move your Pig right, and up and down to move
    your Pig up and down the screen.  Press the red button to grab an object;
    release the button to drop it in place as a 'patch.'
7. To start a new game press reset.  Wait for the Pig to walk to the center
    of its house.  Move the Joystick to bring out the Wolf and start the
    auction.
8. Difficulty Switches.  With the difficulty switches in the 'a' position, your
    Pigs must walk down to the wall to drop an object in place.  In the 'b'
    position, they can drop objects in place from any point on the screen.
    When playing game 3, the Wolf will huff and puff a little slower if your
    difficulty switch is in the 'a' position.
9. Scoring.  Points are earned every time your Pig drops an object in place
    in the wall.  Objects in the first row are worth 4 points each.  Point
    values for each object increase by 4 with each new row (see "Row After
    Row" under "Special Features").  For example, in row 6, each object is
    worth 24 points.  In row 7, each object is worth 28 points.

SPECIAL FEATURES OF OINK! (TM)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three Little Pigs, Three Little Houses.  Each Pig defends its own house.
The first house is made of straw, so it's yellow.  The second is made of
sticks, so it's brown.  The third house is made of bricks, so it's red.
Each time you lose a Pig, you move to the next house and the next Pig.

The Wolf Who Huffs and Puffs.  Whether your house is made of straw or sticks
or bricks, the Wolf will try to blow it down to get the Pig.  He'll blow a
little hole here, then a little hole there.  And, if you don't keep up with 
the Wolf, he'll turn little holes into big holes.  Then he'll chase after your
Pig.

Losing a Pig.  If your Pig is struck by the Wolf's breath, he will fall down
to the bottom of the wall, losing precious time.  And, if the hole is wide
enough for the Pig to fit through, the Wolf's breath will take him right out
onto the lawn.  And then you've lost a Pig.

Row After Row After Row.  Every time a row of objects is used up, a new row
appears.  With each new row, point values increase.  But as they do, the
Wolf gets tougher and tougher.

If You Can't Beat Him, Join Him.  You and a friend can take turns helping the
Wolf in his homewrecking crusade.  In game number 3, each player will alter-
nately have 3 turns helping the Wolf and 3 turns helping the Pigs.  Points
are scored only while you're helping the Pigs.  At the end of the game, total
scores are shown for both players.
