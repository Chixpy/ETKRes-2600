GAME PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS<br>
<br>
[picture of a spaceman in a spaceship]<br>
<br>
You're strapped in your laser ship, battling fierce Deltoids and Shields.<br>
They approach in waves, at faster and faster speeds. Each raider can shoot <br>
a single flash of proton energy that comes at you like a lightning bolt.<br>
<br>
There's no time to waste. And no place to hide. Then, as you carry on the<br>
defense, things get much worse. A far-off sun explodes! Fragments from the<br>
cataclysm come raining down. Keep moving!<br>
<br>
Blast almost everything you see! If you don't, heat from the solar debris<br>
can destroy your planet. If you prevail, you can move out to the edge of<br>
space and attack your foes. Sweet revenge!<br>
<br>
<br>
GAME OBJECTIVE<br>
<br>
* Hit as much solar debris as you can, without losing your laser ship.<br>
* Allow the fewest possible objects to reach your planet's surface, or it <br>
will overheat and explode.<br>
* Shoot passing fleet ships from your orbital platform to win extra lasers<br>
when your score goes up 500 points.<br>
<br>
<br>
CONTROLS<br>
<br>
* USE PADDLE CONTROLLERS TO PLAY THIS GAME.<br>
* Aim laser ship with the paddle:<br>
* Turn clockwise to move right.<br>
* Turn counter-clockwise to move left.<br>
* Press red button to fire laser.<br>
* Pull GAME SELECT lever to shift between 1 and 2-Player game variations.<br>
* Difficulty Switches have no effect on game action.<br>
<br>
<br>
GAME PLAY<br>
<br>
* 1-Player game: Press red button on LEFT Paddle Controller.<br>
* 2-Player game: PULL GAME SELECT lever. A &quot;2&quot; will appear at the top of the<br>
screen.<br>
* The first player uses the LEFT Paddle Controller, and starts his turn by<br>
pressing the red button.<br>
* For details of 2-Player game action, see &quot;Game Variations&quot;.<br>

<br>
<br>
PLANETARY SURFACE<br>
<br>
* In the first battle, you must defend the planet surface with your laser<br>
ship. You have 3 in reserve.<br>
* The first wave of attackers shoot lightning-fast bolts of proton energy<br>
down toward the planet surface.<br>
* Keep your laser ship moving. Position it beneath shooting objects just<br>
long enough to fire at them!<br>
* You have this advantage: each shooting object can fire only once. But<br>
you can fire at them repeatedly, until they descend to your planet's<br>
surface.<br>

LANDERS SUN SPOTS SIZZLOIDS<br>
<br>
<br>
* More objects fall in subsequent waves.<br>
* A wave ends when:<br>
* You shoot all objects or they reach your planet, OR<br>
* you lose a laser ship.<br>
* If an object or its ray hits you, you lose a laser ship.<br>
* As the game goes on, targets fall faster and faster, and at different<br>
angles. Some will shoot at you.<br>
* The most important solar fragments are the Sizzloids! They can appear<br>
during any wave.<br>
* If you hit a Sizzloid you clear the entire screen for a brief period and<br>
receive 50 points.<br>
* If you allow a Sizzloid to reach your planet's surface, it adds a lot to<br>
the heat build-up that can end the game!<br>
* The longer the game lasts, the more frequently Sizzloids appear.<br>
<br>
<br>
ORBITAL PLATFORM<br>
<br>
* At the end of a wave when your score reaches 500, 1000, 1500, etc., the<br>
orbital platform appears. Now you can earn more points and an extra laser<br>
ship (up to a total of 8).<br>
<br>
<br>
[BONUS-SCREEN SHOT SHOWING &quot;COUNTDOWN TIMER&quot;; TOP-LEFT, &quot;SCORE&quot;;
TOP-RIGHT,<br>
&quot;ORBITAL GUN SPOTTER&quot;; (A SMALL RECTANGLE) NEAR YOUR PLANET, AND A COUPLE<br>
OF ENEMY &quot;FLEET SHIPS&quot; PASSING BY, TOP &amp; BOTTOM. (NOTE:- YOUR PLANET AND<br>
THE ENEMY FLEET SHIPS ARE SHOWN AS PART OF THE GAME START-UP SCREEN.)]<br>
<br>
<br>
* To earn the bonus laser, you must hit at least 5 of the fleet ships before<br>
the timer counts down to zero.<br>
* Turn the Paddle Controller to aim the orbital gun spotter, then press<br>
the red button to fire.<br>
* If you hit 5 targets in time you'll hear a fast clicking sound. The<br>
remaining fleet ships change color.<br>
* Each time you see the orbital platform your available time is a little<br>
shorter, but the fleet ships move at the same speed.<br>
* When time runs out, you return to the planet surface.<br>
* Note: It's possible to earn two bonus screens in a row, if your score<br>
passes a 500-point level during an orbital platform sequence. For example:<br>
If your score reaches 940 while you were on the planet surface and you hit<br>
7 fleet ships from the orbital platform, the bonus sequence would be<br>
repeated.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE HEAT FACTOR<br>
<br>
* The Heat Indicator bars on both sides of the screen tell you how much<br>
solar radiation your planet has absorbed.<br>
* If too much debris reaches the surface of the planet, the heat will be<br>
too intense for you to survive, and the game will end.<br>
* At the beginning of the game the Heat Indicators are blue, and relatively<br>
low. As your planet absorbs falling targets, the Indicators grow taller<br>
and change color. At extremely high temperatures they begin to flash.<br>
* When the heat indicator bars are flashing, the next deadly hit may cause<br>
the planet to overheat and explode, thus ending the game, even if you<br>
have some laser ships left.<br>
* Targets have different heat-raising effects:<br>
* Each SUN SPOT has very little heating power.<br>
* Each DELTOID, SHIELD, and LANDER adds somewhat more heat.<br>
* Each SOLAR FLARE adds quite a lot of heat.<br>
* Each SIZZLOID is very hot -- just a few of them can make the planet<br>
overheat and explode!<br>
* If you hit several objects one after the other, the planet cools down. The<br>
indicators will gradually get shorter and change color back to blue.<br>
* Your planet's heat level doesn't change during the orbital platform sequ-<br>
ence, between waves or during your opponent's turn in a 2-player version.<br>
* If solar debris hits your laser ship, it does not raise the temperature on<br>
the planet surface.<br>
<br>
<br>
GAME VARIATIONS<br>
<br>
* When playing alone, use only the LEFT Paddle Controller, and continue until<br>
the screen flashes and the game is over.<br>
* When 2 play, the starting player uses the LEFT controller; his opponent<br>
uses the RIGHT controller.<br>
* Each player's turn lasts for 1 wave (plus a bonus screen sequence, if<br>
earned).<br>
* Player #1's score is red. Player #2's score is blue.<br>
* If one player loses all laser guns or if his planet overheats, the other<br>
player battles on as long as possible.<br>
* When the game ends for both players, their final scores flash alternately.<br>
* To start another game, press red button on LEFT controller.<br>
<br>
<br>
SCORING<br>
<br>
Each SUN SPOT hit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5<br>
Each DELTOID or SHIELD BLASTER or LANDER hit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10<br>
Each SOLAR FLARE hit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20<br>
Each SIZZLOID hit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50<br>
Each FLEET SHIP hit (from orbital platform) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10<br>
<br>
<br>
STRATEGY TIPS<br>
<br>
* Remember, Deltoid and Shield Blasters can each fire at you only once. Try<br>
to wait until they take their shots before moving your laser into firing<br>
position.<br>
* When you hit a Sizzloid the whole screen is cleared. In later stages of <br>
the game you can avoid the dangers of many falling targets by waiting <br>
until the last possible second to hit a Sizzloid.<br>
