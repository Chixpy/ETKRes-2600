Note - this is the same game as Demon Attack!

             CREATURE STRIKE INSTRUCTIONS

Marooned on the ice planet Krybor, you watch legions of
eerie creatures scream overhead. They hover ominously.
Attack and destroy them - or be destroyed!. Armed with
your Laser Cannon, you confront the ultimate challenge:
SURVIVE!

                      GAME PLAY
--------------------------------------------------------

Destroy demons and accumulate points before you and
your Laser Cannon meet with oblivion. Keep reserve
bunkers intact and increase their number by avoiding
your foes' fire. When the last bunker disintegrates, the
next enemy hit will pulverize you!

* Your Laser Cannon has unlimited firing power.
* Dodge left or right to avoid enemy fire while pursuing
  aliens.
* Accumulate reserve bunkers (bottom left of screen).
  You begin with 3.
* Each attack wave you survive completely unscathed
  earns you an additional bunker, to a maximum of 6.
* Every hit you absorb destroys a bunker.
* When all bunkers disappear, another alien barrage will
  vaporize you.

                    HAND CONTROLS

  Position controller so that the red firing button rests in
  the upper left hand corner. To move the Laser Cannon

  right.

         2 players: set both Left and Right Difficulty Levers.

1-Player Games
Games 1, 3, 5 and 7 pit you against progressively more
difficult waves of alien adversaries. Pick up the pace: the
higher the game number, the greater the challenge!
Games 3 and 7 feature special tracer shots. Your Laser
Cannon powers fire all over the screen.

2-Player Games
Games 2, 4, 6 and 8 match your wits against more than
waves of winged warriors!
Each player
      * takes on similar waves of demons
      * manoeuvres a separate Laser Cannon
         Left joystick: red
         Right joystick: gold
      * has own reserve bunkers
      * registers an independent score which shows when
        your Laser Cannon appears on the screen.

* Play alternates between players at the end of each wave.
* If both players survive the assault, they proceed to the
  next wave.
* If one player loses all reserve bunkers and gets vaporized,
  the other continues on to succeeding waves.
* Both players' scores show at game's end, keyed to Laser
  Cannon colour.
* Games 4 and 8 feature special tracer shots.

Special Co-op Versions
Games 9 and 10 allow 2 players to take turns against the
same wave of attack.

* Laser Cannon control alternates every four seconds.
  Keep track of your colour!
* Independent scores appear on screen.
* You share reserve bunkers; when they're gone, another
  blast ends the game.
         Game 9: uses standard weaponry
         Game 10: uses tracer shots
* If you are hit in games 9 or 10, your "partner" scores an
  additional 500 points.
