GAME CONCEPT

to control your advance  *  You can attack the enemy from any direction 
*  Their strategy will change as they get closer, so try to find their 
weakness quickly  *  Keep away from the 'slip zone', where control of the 
tank is difficult  *  Don't waste fuel by firing at random.

BEFORE STARTING

Control Lever

I.      Using the control lever
        1) Use the left-hand control only for a solo game. When playing with
           a partner, Player 1 uses the left-hand control, and Player 2 the
           right.
        2) Start the game by pressing the red button on the control lever.
        3) When playing with a partner, take turns starting from the player
           on the left.
        4) You cannot start the game from the player on the right.
        5) If you push the control lever forwards, the tank will go faster.
           If you pull it towards you, it will slow down.
        6) Move the tank to the left and right by moving the lever to the
           left and right respectively.
        7) When playing with a partner, the player on the left has the red
           tank, and the player on the right has the white tank.
        8) Press the red button to fire shells from the tank.

Game Selection

II.     Select a solo or partner game using the GAME SELECT switch.
        1) When you press the GAME SELECT switch, the figures 1 or 2 will
           appear in the top right-hand corner of the screen.
        2) 1 means a solo game, 2 means a partner game.
        3) You cannot vary the difficulty of the game.
        4) If you press the GAME SELECT switch in the middle of a game, it
           will go back to the 'ready to play' state.

Resetting the Game

III.    You can reset a game in the middle using the GAME RESET switch.
        1) If you press the GAME RESET button in the middle of a game, the
           same game will start from the beginning.
        2) You can also use the GAME RESET switch at other times.

Game Sequence
     
IV.     This game is made up of two parts, SCENE 1 and SCENE 2. The scene
        changes each time you complete one scene by passing through a
        triumphal arch. Each scene is counted as one pattern, and the
        respective pattern number will be displayed at the top center of
        the screen as the GAME START melody is being played.

SCENE 1 

Move forward by destroying the blocks that are in your path with shells from
the tank. But if the tank gets onto the GREEN ZONE, it will start to slip
and use up more fuel. The enemy gun position is aiming at your tank, so try
to get round to the side or behind it and destroy it with shells. An alarm
will sound when you are running out of fuel, but if you successfully manage
to re-fuel, you can get through the enemy lines and pass through the
triumphal arch --- and so on into the next scene ......

1) Destroying the blocks

     *  Destroy the blocks by firing shells from the tank, and move forward
        widening your path as you go.
     *  The tank will explode if it collides with a block.
     *  If the tank gets onto the GREEN ZONE, it will slip, lose speed, and
        use up more fuel.

2) Enemy attacks

     *  The enemy is aiming his shells at the tank.
     *  The speed of his shells will vary with the color of the gun position
        and the range.

3) Re-fuelling

     *  When you start running out of fuel, the fuel guage will turn red and
        an alarm will sound.
     *  In order to re-fuel, the tank must move to on top of the fuel tank.
        When the re-fuelling sound is heard, the fuel tank will disappear
        from the screen, and the fuel guage at the bottom right hand corner
        of the screen will indicate full.

4) Triumphal arch

     *  When you pass through the triumphal arch, that is the end of the 
        scene and you get bonus points and an extra tank. Please note that
        the display can show a maximum of two reserve tanks only.

SCENE 2 

In this scene enemy aircraft make a surprise attack. Shoot them down with
shells whilst avoiding the missiles from the planes zig-zagging at you. If
the tank gets up onto the ORANGE ZONE, it will start to slip and use up
more fuel.

1) Surprise attack by the enemy

     *  The enemy aircraft approach in zig-zag fashion, and attack with
        missiles.
     *  The tank will not be destroyed if an aircraft passes over it.
     *  If the tank gets onto the ORANGE ZONE, it will start to slip and
        use up more fuel.
     *  Re-fuelling is the same as in SCENE 1.


MISTAKES

V.      The following are mistakes, and you lose one of your tanks:
        * If the tank is hit by an enemy shell
        * If the tank is hit by an enemy missile
        * If the tank collides with a block
