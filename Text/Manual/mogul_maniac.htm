<h2><strong><font face="Verdana">Mogul Maniac</font></strong></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>GAME OBJECTIVE</strong><br>
Quite simply, the objective of Mogul Maniac is to get through the open and closed gates
and down the mountain as quickly as possible without breaking anything on or around your
body...<br>
<br>
<strong>SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br>
1. Connect the Atari 2600TM, Sears Video Arcade or compatible unit to your television
according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
2. With the Power Switch OFF, plug in Mogul Maniac Power-Play cartridge.<br>
3. Plug The Joyboard into left controller slot and turn the Power Switch ON.<br>
4. Push the Game Reset lever. Actual game play does not begin until you lean forward on
The Joyboard.<br>
<br>
<strong>THE JOYBOARD</strong><br>
Mogul Maniac has been designed to faithfully reproduce an actual downhill slalom ski run.<br>
You control The Joyboard in much the same way as a pair of skis. Leaning forward increases
your speed; backwards slows you down. As in real skiing leaning on the LEFT side of The
Joyboard causes the screen image to move to the .RIGHT, and leaning on the RIGHT side
causes the screen image to move to the LEFT.<br>
<br>
However, if you prefer, Mogul Maniac can be played in the joystick mode, where leaning
LEFT moves the screen image to the LEFT and vice versa. The Black &amp; White/Color switch
determines which mode you're in: real skiing is Color; joystick is Black &amp; White. If
desired, a joystick can be substituted for The Joyboard.<br>
<br>
<strong>GAME INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br>
After you push the Game Reset button, the starting gate will appear on-screen. The timer
does not start until you lean forward on The Joyboard and through the starting gate.<br>
<br>
Each course gate consists of two poles of the same color, red or blue. Open gates are
positioned side-by-side; closed gates are staggered poles (see illustration on next page).
You must ski between poles of the same color.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">There are nine different courses for you to master.&nbsp; You may
choose different runs by pushing the Game Select button.&nbsp; The course number will
appear in the upper part of the screen, as well as the number of gates and the maximum
possible speed for the run.&nbsp; Once you have selected a run, push Game Reset to start.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>DIFFICULTY SWITCHES<br>
</strong>When the left difficulty switch is in the novice position, you will be docked
five seconds for each gate you miss.&nbsp; In the expert position, you will be
disqualified if you miss a gate and your time will become 9:59.9.&nbsp; You can, however,
complete the run.&nbsp; The right difficulty switch controls whether or not the hill has
moguls: expert position has them; novice does not.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Each player is allowed two runs at a given course.&nbsp; You
cannot change courses between runs.&nbsp; After your first run is completed, the timer
will stop and the course will be set up for a second run.&nbsp; Because the best time is a
combination of both runs, the timer will start where it stopped on the first run.
&nbsp; After you've completed the second course, the total time for both runs will be
displayed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">There is no limit to the number of players.&nbsp; However, only
the fastest time will remain on the screen.&nbsp; If several people are playing, pencil
and paper will help in keeping track of individual times.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>SKI TIPS<br>
</strong>Watch your speed!&nbsp; As in real skiing, it is possible to get into a
&quot;runaway&quot; where you have little control over your skis.&nbsp; If you miss a
gate, don't sweat it.&nbsp; Concentrate on making the next one.&nbsp; If you get off the
course and find yourselves in the trees, slow down and lean over until you are back on the
course.&nbsp; Then you better hustle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">If you get disqualified, finish the run.&nbsp; You can probably
use the practice.&nbsp; Experiment with your gate approaches and speed.&nbsp; Then
concentrate on your next run.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Study the ski run charts provided in this manual.&nbsp; They will
help you in mapping out each course.&nbsp; Watch for patterns in the various runs as you
ski them.&nbsp; They'll also help you improve your times.&nbsp; Good luck.&nbsp; And break
a leg (it had to be said...)<br>
