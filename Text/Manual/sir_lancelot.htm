<strong>SIR LANCELOT</strong><br>
Video Game<br>
<br>
You are SIR LANCELOT. Astride your winged horse PEGASUS, you set out on a<br>
quest to save a poor maiden held prisoner in a castle by a fire-breathing<br>
dragon. As you start your journey, winged creatures wil try to kill you,<br>
but with your charmed lance and carefull flying by PEGASUS, you can<br>
overcome their challenge. You collect points for each creature destroyed<br>
and when all are gone you reach the castle and face the dragon. The wily<br>
dragon will not fight you directly, for he has seen how you devastated<br>
the creatures outside, and beathes its fire at you from behind a magic<br>
screen. The fire will not kill you, but will temporarily stun PEGASUS so<br>
he cannot flap his wings. Kill the dragon with your lance and you will<br>
save the maiden. Once the dragon is killed, you will face new creatures<br>
guarding another castle, and these defenders will have heard of your<br>
exploits and be more difficult and so will the dragon.<br>
<br>

PLAY ACTION - SCREENS 1, 3, 5, 7<br>
<br>
OUTSIDE THE CASTLE<br>
When the game begins, SIR LANCELOT has been challenged to free the land<br>
from villainous flying beasts and to save the fair maidens from their<br>
captors, the dragons. Each of the castles in the quest are surrounded by<br>
successively more dangerous flying creatures that try to keep SIR LANCELOT<br>
from reaching the castle and saving the maiden.<br>
<br>
FLIGHT AND CONTROL<br>
Using your FIRE BUTTON to contol the flapping wings of SIR LANCELOT'S<br>
flying horse, PEGASUS, and using the JOYSTICK to guide your direction<br>
and deadly lance, you control SIR LANCELOT'S attack of the beasts. To<br>
maintain flight the player must repeatedly push the FIRE BUTTON to flap<br>
PEGASUS' wings. The frequency of his wing beats determines a climb, hover,<br>
or drive. Left or right JOYSTICK direction combined with wing flapping<br>
will create, horizontal flight. Upward or downward JOYSTICK direction<br>
will produce a climb or dive. Reversing direction during horizontal flight<br>
will stop forwrd momentum. PEGASUS will not turn upside down, so loops and<br>
inverted flight are not possible - otherwise SIR LANCELOT would fall off!<br>
<br>
COMBAT<br>
In order for SIR LANCELOT to rid the air of the beasts and clear his path<br>
to the castles, he must use his lance to destroy the creatures. As the<br>
foes increase in difficulty through screens 1, 3, 5 and 7, the same basic<br>
rules for combat apply. The differences are found in the speed of attack<br>
and flying skills. Because of SIR LANCELOT'S weapon. the lance, a planned<br>
collision results in the creature's defeat. If only one of the combatants<br>
is facing the collision point, then he wins. If both combatants are facing<br>
each other, the higher one wins. If both are at the same hight, then it is<br>
a tie and neither SIR LANCELOT nor the beast will be destroyed. If neither<br>
the creature nor SIR LANCELOT are facing each other again it is a tie.<br>
When a tie occurs, the two combatants &quot;bounce&quot; of each other.<br>
<br>
PAY ACTION - SCREENS 2, 4, 6, 8<br>
<br>
THE LAVA POOL INSIDE THE CASTLE<br>
After you have defeated the creatures outside of the castle, SIR LANCELOT<br>
moves to the scene inside the castle where a dragon holds a maiden captive.<br>
Each of the maidens in successive screens have different colored dresses on.<br>
Each combat arena has a ledge where SIR LANCELOT starts and can rest, and<br>
each is guarded by a successively more difficult dragon that must be<br>
defeated. Do not tarry, for the lava pool is rising and it will consume<br>
the maiden and even SIR LANCELOT if you can't quickly dispense the dragon.<br>
<br>
DRAGON COMBAT<br>
By using your flying skills you must defeat the dragons by spearing your<br>
lance into the soft stomach of the monsters. The wily dragon will not<br>
fight you directly for it has seen your performance outside. It breathes<br>
its fire at from behind a magic wall. Only the magic lancecan penetrate<br>
the wall and kill the dragon. SIR LANCELOT and PEGASUS will bounce off<br>
the wall - so fly with skill. You must be quick to avoid the fire from<br>
the dragon. Each successive screen will have faster, more accurate dragons<br>
whose stomach have more and more armor. In the highest screens a direct<br>
hit is necessary in the exact middle of the stomach to be victorious. Once<br>
the dragon is killed, the magic wall and the gragon will disappear. You<br>
will save the maiden, and you will go to a harder quest. FARE THEE WELL!<br>
<br>
