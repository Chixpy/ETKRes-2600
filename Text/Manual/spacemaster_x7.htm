SPACEMASTER X-7 (tm)<br>
<br>
TO SET UP: <br>
<br>
Set up your video computer system and left joystick controller as instructed <br>
in your game system owner's manual. Turn the power OFF. Insert the game<br>
cartridge and then turn the power ON. The Difficulty Switches and Game <br>
Select Level are not used. You can use the Color/B-W Lever to pause the <br>
game at any time during play. Flip the Color/B-W Lever back or press the<br>
joystick button to resume play. Press the Reset Lever or the joystick button <br>
to head into deep space and battle the evil Hyperion Empire.<br>
<br>

SHIP&quot; (STAR-LIKE OBJECT). ALSO SHOWS BLACK &quot;TEN BASES DESTROYED&quot;
INDICATOR.]<br>
<br>
<br>
THE CONTROLS: <br>
<br>
Your Assault Ship was specially designed to destroy Hyperion Military Bases.<br>
Assault Ship movement is controlled by tilting the joystick. Missiles are<br>
fired from your unlimited supply of ammunition by pressing the joystick<br>
button. Your ship will not move while the button is pressed, a helpful<br>
feature for firing from inside the Hyperion Base's Force Field.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE OBJECTIVE: <br>
<br>
Your mission is to destroy as many Hyperion Military Bases as possible.<br>
You can fire missiles through the gaps in the Force Field or from inside<br>
the Force Field. If you are able to sneak inside, you must quickly destroy<br>
the Base before the Force Field closes in on your Assault Ship. This is no<br>
easy task! The Base can construct electrifying Shields during battle and is<br>
protected by a variety of deadly defenders. If you are able to avoid all of<br>
them, you will be truly deserving of the title Space Master X-7.<br>
<br>
<br>
SCREEN DISPLAY: <br>
<br>
Your current score is shown at the top of the screen. The battle takes place<br>
in the center of the screen. The number of your Assault Ships remaining is<br>
shown in the lower left corner of the screen. Only 9 Ships can be displayed<br>
at once, but you can earn even more! The number of Hyperion Bases destroyed<br>
is shown in the lower right corner. Each white mark represents one Base<br>
destroyed. Each black mark represents ten Bases destroyed. Although only 39<br>
Bases destroyed can be shown, you can keep on blasting Bases for as long as<br>
you like!<br>
<br>
The Energy Meter in the bottom center of the screen registers the flow of<br>
energy from the Hyperion Base.<br>
<br>
<br>
HYPERION MILITARY BASES:<br>
<br>
Each time one of your missiles hits the Hyperion Base, the Base loses energy.<br>
When the energy level on the Energy Meter registers &quot;-&quot;, the Base will <br>
explode. Direct hits from a steady stream of your missiles will finish off<br>
a Hyperion Base in seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
FORCE FIELD:<br>
<br>
The Hyperion Base is protected by a pulsing Force Field. To get close to the<br>
Base, you must fly your Assault Ship through one of the openings in this<br>
Force Field. If you accidentally hit the Force Field with a missile, the <br>
Hyperion Base will GAIN energy. If you fly your Assault Ship into the Force<br>
Field, you will lose the ship.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
HYPERION DEFENDERS:<br>
<br>
Various Hyperion weapons and war craft will come to the defense of the Base<br>
during the battle. Some are mindless projectiles and others contain sophist-<br>
icated tracking systems.<br>

[SCREEN SHOT SHOWING CURRENT SCORE (TOP-CENTER), HYPERION BASE &quot;ENERGY METER&quot;<br>
(BOTTOM-CENTER), AND &quot;SHIELDS&quot; BUILDING NEXT TO HYPERION BASE.]<br>
<br>
<br>
SHIELDS:<br>
<br>
At the higher levels of play, the Base will begin to construct Shields. The<br>
Shields will continue to grow as long as the Base's energy level is on the<br>
&quot;+&quot; side of the Energy Meter. When the energy level drops to the &quot;-&quot;
side,<br>
the Base will begin to remove parts of the Shields and re-absorb their<br>
energy. Missiles have no effect on the Shields, but if you accidentally fly<br>
into a Shield, you will lose a Ship.<br>
<br>
<br>
SCORING:<br>
<br>
FIREBALL = 25 Points<br>
HEAT SEEKER = 100 Points<br>
BOUNCER = 50 Points<br>
WANDERER = 200 Points<br>
HOMER = 400 Points<br>
BASE HIT = 25 Points per hit<br>
BASE DESTROYED = 1000 Points each for the first four Bases<br>
2000 Points for the next four Bases, and so on.<br>
<br>
You begin each game with five Assault Ships, four in reserve and one in play.<br>
Bonus Ships are awarded for every second Hyperion Base destroyed and after<br>
every 10,000 points.<br>
<br>
<br>
LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY:<br>
<br>
Space Master X-7 gets more and more challenging as you continue to play.<br>
The battle gets faster, the Defenders get more deadly and the Base builds<br>
additional Shield protection at a more rapid rate.<br>
<br>
<br>
HINTS FROM DAVID LUBAR...<br>
<br>
Watch to see which type of defense weapon is forming within the Base. Each<br>
acts differently and requires a different strategy.<br>
<br>
On the higher levels, avoid the area where the Shields will appear first. <br>
Otherwise, you could get hit with no warning.<br>
<br>
When moving through the Force Field, try to fly directly toward the base,<br>
then fire when you are almost touching it. As soon as you hit the button,<br>
you will stop moving.<br>
<br>
At very high levels take your time and hit the Base from outside the Field<br>
until the energy level drops and the outer Shields are absorbed.<br>
