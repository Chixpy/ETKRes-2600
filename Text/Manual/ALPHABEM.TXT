* NOTE TO PARENTS

The ALPHA BEAM game provides children with an exciting outer space setting
in which they can practice important prereading skills such as:

 [ A A ]    1) Matching identical letters.

 [ D d ]    2) Matching upper case letters with their corresponding lower
               case letters.

 [ m n ]    3) Discriminating between confusing letters.

ALPHA BEAM is unique in that it includes opportunities for cooperation.
When you play ALPHA BEAM with your child you can foster coooperative play
by talking to him or her.  As you play, say things like, "Which letter
should we pick up first?"  and, "Where should we put the letter A?"
Encourage your child to talk about the game also.


* SETTING UP

HOW TO USE YOUR ATARI KID'S CONTROLLER

Use your ATARI KID'S CONTROLLERS to play ALPHA BEAM.    

For a one-player game, plug an ATARI KID'S CONTROLLER into the LEFT cont-
roller jack at the back of your ATARI 2600 console. (See Figure 1.) For a
two-player game, the player who operates the top shuttle uses a controller
plugged into the LEFT jack and the player who manuevers the bottom shuttle
uses a controller plugged into the RIGHT jack.

           [Figure 1 - Plugging in the Controller]

You will find two keypad overlays included with this cartridge.  These
colorful overlays will help your children select and use appropriate buttons. 
Slip the overlay tabs into the slots at the top and bottom of your ATARI 
KID'S CONTROLLER, as shown in Figure 2.

                     [Figure 2 - Keypad Overlay]

             --------------------------------------------
               Note: The "Atari Kid's Controller" was a
               large  6" x 7 1/2" Video Touch Pad that
               was bought separately from the game cart.
               The ALPHA BEAM WITH ERNIE overlays for the 
               controller blocked off all but four keys:

* A READ-ALOUD STORY


                           ERNIE THE ASTRONAUT

"Space is terrific," said Ernie the astronaut as he flew his rocket ship
past the beautiful ringed-planet Saturn.  "But I'm really getting homesick
and I miss my old buddy Bert.  I think I'll turn around and start for home.
I'd better take a look at my trusty space map first so I won't get lost."

But as Ernie unfolded the map, his glance fell upon the fuel gauge of his
rocket ship.

"Uh oh!  I'm almost out of fuel!"  Ernie began to worry.  "I hope I can make
it to the next refueling station in time."

Just as his ship coasted to a stop, Ernie spotted the Alpha Beam Fuel 
Station. He put on his space suit and got into his space shuttle to go
collect the fuel for his rocket.

"Boy am I lucky," he said.  "I just made it!"

First, Ernie flew his shuttle over his rocket fuel bays to see what kind of
fuel he needed.  Then, he flew to the fuel station and carefully selected
the right tank for each fuel bay on his ship.

"The `A' fuel tank goes in the `A' docking bay, the `B' fuel tank goes in
the `B' docking bay, and so on," said Ernie.  "If you're planning to fly
a rocket ship through outer space, you've got to know your ABC's!"

Ernie knew he had to fill up the fuel bays as quickly as possible because,
according to his automatic countdown clock, his ship was set to blast off
in a few seconds.

"Nine...eight..." ticked the clock.  (Ernie loaded the first fuel tank.)
"Seven...six...five...four..."  (The `B' and `C' tanks were loaded.)

"Am I loading the fuel correctly?"  Ernie wondered.  "Will my ship make it
all the way back to earth?"

"Three...two..." (Ernie loaded the last tank and jumped aboard his rocket
just as the fuel bays closed.)  "One!  Blast off!"  The great rocket ship
headed towards Earth.

"I sure hope I make it," said Ernie.  "I really miss my old buddy Bert!"

"Ernie began to feel better as he passed Saturn again and saw Jupiter 
straight ahead.

"If I can just get to Mars," he thought.  "Earth is only one stop away."

But Ernie's ship started to slow down.  He looked at the control panel and
saw that his fuel indicator was nearing the empty mark again.

"Oh no!" he groaned.  "I'm running out of fuel.  Now I'll never make it all
the way home.  I'll never see my buddy Bert again!"

"What do you mean, Ernie?" asked Bert.  "Of course you'll see me again.
I'm just going to the kitchen to make oatmeal for breakfast."

Ernie opened his eyes and realized that he was safe in his own room.  His
toy rocket had fallen off his bed and was lying on the floor.

"Boy did I ever have a crazy dream, Bert!" laughed Ernie with relief.
"You'll never believe it, not in a million light-years!"


* GAME PLAY

NOW PLAY ALPHA BEAM...HERE'S HOW:

Oh no!  Ernie's rocket ship is out of gas!  Help Ernie get home by filling
up his rocket and making it blast off!

OBJECT OF THE GAME:

Beam the lettered fuel tanks that are floating in space into the docking bays
of Ernie's rocket ship.

GET READY TO PLAY:

Follow the directions in SETTING UP to plus in the KID'S CONTROLLER, to use
the keypad overlay, and to select a game level.

SHUTTLE MOVEMENT

To move your space shuttle left, press the arrow that points left on your
keypad overlay. ( 4 key )
To move your space shuttle right, press the arrow that points right on your
keypad overlay.  ( 6 key )

BEAM LETTER TO SHUTTLE

If you control the top shuttle, move your shuttle directly under a letter
and press the beam button on your overlay that points up.  ( 2 key )

If you control the bottom shuttle, move your shuttle directly over a letter
and press the beam button on your overlay that points down.  ( 8 key )

BEAM LETTER FROM SHUTTLE TO ROCKET

To beam a letter from the top shuttle into the rocket, move your shuttle over
a fuel bay and press the beam button that points down.

                                             =*= <-----Shuttle (player 2)

 
To beam a letter from the bottom shuttle into the rocket, move your shuttle 
under a fuel bay and press the beam button that points up.

As your child learns to maneuver the shuttlecraft, you may want to give him
or her some step-by-step guidance.  Try saying:

                 * "First move your shuttle to the letter."
                 * "Next, beam the letter onto the shuttle."
                 * "Next, move to the docking bay."
                 * "Now, beam the letter onto the rocket ship."

GAME VARIATIONS

ALPHA BEAM contains 12 levels of game play. Games 1 and 2 are for one player
only, while Games 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11 have one-player and two-player
versions.  Games 6, 7, 8, and 12 are two-player games only.  Remember, when
pressing GAME SELECT, the numeral on the lower left of the screen indicates
game number while the numeral on the lower right indicates player number.
Below are detailed descriptions of each game level.  For quick reference,
use the GAME MATRIX on the back cover.

GAMES 1 AND 2: PRACTICE GAMES

Practice beaming letters onto your shuttlecraft and then into the rocket
fuel bays.  When you want to pick up fuel, press the right or left arrow
on your keypad overlay.  Your shuttle will automatically center under the
nearest fuel tank.  When you are ready to load the fuel on the rocket, press
the right or left arrow to automatically center your shuttle over the
closest fuel bay.  The letters on the fuel tanks and the rocket side are
all the same letter.  Game 1 uses all upper case letters while Game 2 uses
all lower case letters.  Take as much time as you want.  Each time you fill
up Ernie's rocket, it blasts off toward Earth.  Welcome home!  Had enough
practice?  Now try a more challenging game.

In practice games, young children might need some help getting started.
Say to your child, "Point to the letter you want to pick up and show me
which way (left or right) you want to move to get it."  This is also a
good opportunity to talk about the names of the letters on the screen.

GAMES 3, 4, and 5

Match the letters in the sky with those on the side of the rocket.  The four
letters on the side of the rocket are in alphabetical order while the four
lettered tanks in the sky are scrambled.  When you beam the correct letters
from the sky into the rocket bays, you will be putting them in proper
alphabetical order.

You must carefully center your shuttle under and over the letters and rocket
bays.  If you try to beam a letter into a bay where it doesn't match, it
won't go in and you'll hear a loud buzz.

All the letters in Game 3 are in upper case, and all letters in Game 4 are
lower case.  In Game 5 all the letters on the side of the ship are lower
case while the letters in the sky are upper case.  Each time you fuel up
Ernie's ship, it blasts off for home.  What a blast!

GAMES 6, 7, and 8

Now you and your partner must work together to put the same letter pairs
in the top and bottom fuel bays of the rocket. (See Figure 4.) There are
no letters printed on the rocket side so you decide which letters go where.
Once a letter is beamed into a bay, the matching letter will only go into
the adjoining bay.  As soon as you fuel up the ship, it blasts off and you
fly all the way home!

Game 6 uses all upper case letters and Game 7 uses all lower case letters.
In Game 8, the player operating the top shuttle selects from upper case
letters, while the player operating the bottom shuttle selects from lower
case letters.

                     [Figure 4 - Cooperative Game 8]

GAME 9

Match upper case letters in the sky with lower case letters on the ship
before the countdown reaches one.

Game 9 is a timed game.  See the number in the window of the rocket nose?
(See Figure 5.) This is your countdown timer.  You must fuel up Ernie's
rocket as the countdown goes from nine to one.  When the countdown reaches
one, the rocket doors close, and the rocket blasts off.

You get as far as Saturn if each player docks one tank in the right bay.
if each player docks two tanks correctly, you get to Jupiter.  You'll
reach Mars if each player puts three tanks in the right bays.  And you'll
fly all the way to home sweet planet Earth if all four tanks are correctly
placed!  Welcome home Ernie! (See Figure 6.)

                     [Figure 5 - Timed Game]
           (Shows Countdown Timer in the nose of rocket)

                   [figure 6 - Ernie gets Home]

GAMES 10 and 11

Now each player must choose among five letterd tanks in the sky to match
four lettered bays in the rocket.

Don't be surprised if the letters in the sky do not match the letters on the
rocket.  Each time you beam a letter from the sky it is replaced by the next
letter in the alphabet.  For example, beam a "K" onto your shuttle and it is
replaced by an "L" in the sky; beam that"L" onto your shuttle and it's 
replaced by an "M."  When you take the letter "Z" it is replaced by an "A."
If you don't want to keep a letter that you beam onto your shuttle, simply
beam another letter aboard your shuttle and the one you don't want will 
disappear into the air!  You can beam through as many letters as you like
this way until you have the letter you need to fill in the rocket bay.

All letters in Game 10 are upper case; all letters in Game 11 are lower
case.  You have more time to dock your letters in Game 10 than in Game 11.
In both games, the countdown starts at nine, and when it reaches one, your
ship blasts off!  How far will you get?  As in Game 9, that depends upon
how many fuel bays you filled correctly.

You may want to talk about the concept of alphabetical order with your child.
Encourage him or her to think about each letter on the screen and ask,
"What letter comes next in the alphabet?"

GAME 12

You and a partner beam matching letters into pairs of adjoining rocket bays.
All upper case letters float above the rocket, while all lower case letters
float below it.  When you take a letter from the sky, it is replaced by the
next letter of the alphabet.  So, although you and your partner may not start 
out with matching letters, you can work together to create letter pairs by
replacing letters in the sky until you make a match.  The clock on the
rocket ship will give you a quick countdown, so work fast and see how far
you can make that rocket go when it blasts off!

GAME 12: SUPERCHALLENGE

When you've mastered matching letters randomly, try a more challenging game.
See how fast you and your partner can spell these words together:

   HOME         BERT         STAR       SHIP        FAST          DOCK

   MOON         MARS         ZOOM       BEAM        FUEL          GAME

You can also make your own list of words with four letters or ask your
parent or friend to make one for you.
