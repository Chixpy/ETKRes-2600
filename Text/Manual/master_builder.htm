THE MASTER CONTRACT:
To become a MASTER BUILDER, you have to complete construction of several
buildings in SPECTRAVILLE.  Try to remember the blueprints of the buildings
which will appear on screen for only 5 seconds.  Don't worry about the
buildings materials supply.  You can get substantial volume of bricks from
stores and construct the building by laying them in the appropriate
position.  A MAGIC LADDER will help you in carrying out your hob on the
upper floors.  But don't forget the troublesome SPECTRADOG, naughty KID and
the powerful destructive LIGHTNING.

If the construction is succesfully accomplished, you can leave the site by
catching a HELICOPTER.  However, you will lose a chance every time your
finished construction is not according to the blueprint, so THINK before
catching the HELICOPTER.

one chance!
