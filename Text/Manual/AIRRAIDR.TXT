AIR RAIDERS
	

Instructions (for 1 player)
---------------------------

The object of the game is to blast enemy aircraft out of the sky...and 
dodge ground missiles!!!  Zero in on enemy planes!  Bank left, bank 
right, dive, climb out!  Watch your elevation!  Keep track of the fuel?  
Run out of ammo...land and refuel...take off again!



THE GAME
--------

It's a dogfight...you against the enemy!  You're the pilot, gunner and 
navigator all in one!!!  Enemy planes are buzzing you.  Anti-Aircraft 
ground forces are shelling you!

Get an enemy plane in your sights and FIRE!  Try to shoot down as many as 
you can!  If ground fire (flak) explodes in your sight...you're hit...you 
quickly lose altitude.  Climb back up!  Stay clear of the flack!

[picture of screen.  The following things are pointed out:  Enemy 
Aircraft (do I need to explain what these look like?), Your Gunsight (see 
Enemy Aircraft), Ground Shelling (Flak) (they look like little diamonds 
in the sky), Horizon (that line where the color goes from green to blue), 
Remaining Ammunition (the number above the word "Amo"), Heavy Flack Zone 
(this is the middle of that bar at the very bottom of the screen), Your 
Plane Position (the white line that travels in the bar on the bottom of 
the screen), Remaining Fuel (the bar just above the bottom bar), Altitude 
Gauge (the number above the word "ALT"), and Number of Planes Shot Down (the 
number above the word "HITS")]

You must shoot down at least 10 planes before you can land to refuel then 
take off again!  The game ends when you run out of ammo completely or 
when you crash!  Press RESET and start again.  Try to get a better score 
each time.  Challenge a friend!



THE CONTROLS
-------------

Use the left joystick controller for this game.  Be sure the controller 
cable is securely plugged into the back of your game console.  Hold the 
controller so the RED BUTTON is to your upper left.

LET'S START THE ACTION!
-----------------------

CHOOSE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY:

Before the game begins, set your LEFT Difficulty Switch to "A" or "B".  
It's much harder to get away from enemy shelling in the "A" position.


TAKE OFF:

When you start a game, and after you refuel, press the RED BUTTON.  The 
runway lights appear to move as your plane starts to move.  When you gain 
speed (about 4 seconds), pull back on the the JOYSTICK for takeoff.  If 
you try to take off before gaining enough speed, you will crash!  Wait 
too long before takeoff and you will run out of runway.  You'll quickly 
get the hang of the timing!

Once airborne, keep clear of enemy flak and be on the alert for enemy 
planes!!!


FLY THE PLANE:

Fly the plane by pushing on the JOYSTICK.  You can make the plane fly in 
four different directions.  You can quickly change the direction the 
plane is flying.  If you don't move the Joystick, you level off and fly 
straight ahead.  

Push to make the plane climb [picture of joystick being pushed down}

Push to make the plane bank left [picture of joystick being pushed left]

Push to make the plane dive [picture of joystick being pushed up]

Push to make the plane bank right [picture of joystick being pushed right]

Your point of view is through the cockpit window.  As you "turn" the 
plane, your view changes.

Turn left and dive: see more ground

ground is seen]

AIM AND FIRE:

You're on a gunnery misson!  To fire, get the enemy in your sights, then 
press the RED BUTTON.  Make a direct hit and the enemy plane blows up!

IMPORTANT:  Don't stop shooting until you are really low on fuel!  It's 
important to make as many hits as you can when airborne!


WATCH THE GAUGES

It's important to keep an eye on your gauges.  You can fly to a maximum 
40 altitude (This is 40,000 feet).  There aren't many enemy planes at 
this altitude.  Be extra careful when you dive.  You lose altitude fast!  
Get down under 10 and you'd better climb out before you crash!

Once you are airborne you begin using fuel.  Climbing uses about 4 times 
as much fuel as diving, and about twice as much as flying level.

Before liftoff, your gauges look like this.
[picture of gauges.  Alt and Hits are at zero.  Amo is at 99.  The 
plane's position is in the middle of the bottom gauge, and the fuel 
gauge is full]

When you get really low on fuel, it's time to land and refuel!  Time this 
carefully or you might run out of fuel and crash!

Watch the plane position indicator.  Fly into the red zone and you're 
into heavy flak.  This zone is even more dangerous at the low altitudes.  
Keep out of this zone as much as possible.


LAND...REFUEL...TAKE OFF AGAIN:

You can land at any time.  BUT you can only refuel and take off again if 
you made at least 10 hits the last time up!  Wait until you are really 
low on fuel then fly down to 00 altitude.  Wait for the runway to appear, 
approximately 4 seconds.  Push forward on the JOYSTICK until the horizon 
is all the way up, then release the JOYSTICK.  You've landed!

Once you land to refuel, you lose some ammo.  Check you ammo gauge.  You 
only have as much ammo as the number of hits you made last time up.  For 
example, if you got 11 hits then landed, you will take off with 11 ammo 
after refueling.  If you are a crack shot, you can refuel several times!

Once the plane is level after landing, you can take off again.  Remember 
to gain enough speed before takeoff!

IMPORTANT:  The game ends if you crash, or if you run completely out of 
ammo and cannot take off again!


ENEMY PLANES:

Enemy planes usually fly in threes.  Shoot one and two are left.  Go 
after them!  This is when you need to get fancy with your flying.  If 
they fly left or right, follow them.  If you need to conserve fuel, try 
to shoot down as many enemy planes as you can without climbing or diving.

WINNING TIPS
------------

* Shoot down as many enemy planes as you can the first time in the air.  
  don't refuel until you absolutely need to.  The more hits you make, the 
  more ammo you get the next time up!

* When you see flack near your sight, pull back on the JOYSTICK so you 
  are climbing when you get hit.  This way you won't dive as much when you 
  actually get hit.



And of course, this game was made by M Network.  And this game manual
