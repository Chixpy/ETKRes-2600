DRAGONFIRE

Game Program designed by Bob Smith


Dragons have driven the Royal Court from the Castle

"O we are lost, lost" laments the King.  "Without our vast treasures we 
cannot raise an army 'gainst these accursed dragons.  Our Kingdom must 
now languish under lizards!"

"Nay, not so, my liege!" replied the young Prince.  "None knows that Castle,
those many bridges and storerooms, better than I.  Give me leave and I 
shall loot those lizards of their plunder and restore my lord to his 
birthright."

"Brave boy," said the King, fully pleased.  "But," he added darkly, 
"beware dread dragonfire!"



GAME OBJECTIVE
--------------

To reach the King's treasure's, the Prince runs across the bridge.  He 
must dodge fireballs tossed by Dragon Hatchlings.  He nimbly ducks under 
the high ones and leaps over the low ones.  Fortunately, the fireballs 
can't hurt the Prince if he runs back into the tower at the right end of 
the bridge.

When the Prince reaches the left side of the bridge, he arrives in the 
storeroom.  He's inside a hiding place he can return to any time.  The 
storeroom is filled with beautiful objects--and a fierce dragon whose 
very breath can cost the Prince one of his seven precious chances!

When the Dragon looks the other way, the Prince runs to each object and 
retrieves it for the King.  And when he has bravely cleared out the room 
of its treasures, a way of escape appears.  He runs to it and reappears 
on the bridge, ready for another daring raid.

Help the Prince get as many treasures as possible, before he's hit by 
fireballs or Dragonfire seven times!

fireballs are red and come from the left side of the screen.  The score 
is the number at the bottom center of the screen.  The remaining chances 
are the little men bellow the score.]



GAME PLAY

~ Watch out for dragons' fireballs!  They're thrown high and low.
  ~ If the Prince is hit by a fireball, he loses one chance.
  ~ To duck, pull joystick toward you.

  ~ To jump, press the red button.
  ~ The Prince leaps farther when he's running toward the fireballs, not just
    standing still.
  ~ The Prince can jump while he's ducking, to avoid fireballs that come 
    close together.
  ~ To jump while squatting, pull joystick toward you and press button at the
    same time.

~ Cross the bridge safely and you will reach the treasure room.
~ Push joystick left to leave the hiding place.
  ~ The Prince can return to his hiding place for safety whenever he's in the
    room.
~ Move the Prince to every object in the room--but watch out for the Dragon!
~ When the last object has been taken, the exit appears at the upper left 
  screen.  Move the Prince to the exit, and escape.
~ After escaping, you reappear on the bridge.  Get ready for another raid and
  another Dragon.  The treasures may be more valuable each time, but beware:

screen.  The hiding place (entrance) is at the bottom right corner of the 
screen.  The exit location (when room is cleared) is at the upper left 
corner of the screen.]



EVERY DRAGON YOU MEET IS HARDER TO BEAT!
----------------------------------------

  ~ Left player's score is black; the right player's is red.
  ~ Scores flash alternately at the end of the game, when players have 
    each used all 7 chances.



TACTICAL TIPS
-------------

~ Don't spend any more time on the bridge than you have to.  Cross it as 
  fast as you can and you'll encounter fewer fireballs.
~ If you face an impossible combination of fireballs on the bridge, run 
  back to the right tower if you can make it in time...you're safe 
  there.  Or make the Prince squeeze through close-trailing fireballs by 
  jumping from a crouch (pull joystick and press button at the same time).
~ In the treasure room, run fast to the objects.  KEEP MOVING!  Return to the
  hiding place if you need a rest, because the Dragon never stops hunting.
