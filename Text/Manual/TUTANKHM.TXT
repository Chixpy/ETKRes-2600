Inside King Tut's tomb are treasures beyond your wildest dreams.  They can be
yours...if you dare to take them.  Supernatural creatures roam the mazes of the
tomb guarding the treasures at all costs.  Your only defenses against them are
your laser gun...and your wits.  Blast away, snatch the loot, escape through
secret passageway before it's too late!  And when you see a key, take that,
too.  It will unlock the door to the next chanber and the next adventure.  Enter
King Tut's tomb and see what awaits you...if you dare.

OBJECT

To score as many points as you can by recovering treasures and defeating the
guardians of the tomb.

SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS

1. Select a game level number (see GAME SELECTION on back page) by pressing
down on the GAME SELECT switch.  The game number will appear at the bottom of
the screen.

2. Press down the GAME RESET switch and you're ready to start the action.

THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLERS

Plug the Joystick controllers firmly into the jacks at the back of your video
system.  Use the LEFT controller jack for one-player games.  Use the Joystick
to move your archeologist left, right, up, or down.  To fire your laser gun,
press the fire button and--at the same time--move the Joystick either left or
right to fire in that direction.  To create a laser flash, hold down the fire
button and--at the same time--move the Joystick up.

PLAYING

When the game begins, you're an archeologist with three "lives."  You're in the
first of four burial chambers inside King Tut's tomb.  Take a minute to look
at the illustration to the left.

As soon as you press RESET, start moving the archeologist through the maze.
These are the things you must do:

Find the Key.  Inside each chamber is a key.  As soon as you see it, go after
it.  You'll need it in order to enter the next chamber at the end of the maze.
Once you have the key you'll see it in the archeologist's hand.

Watch out for Creature Nests.  Throughout the maze are creatures' nests.
Creatures of varying speeds and species can spring fromthem at any time.  Just
before they do, however, you'll hear a "slurp-like" sound.  When you hear it,
get ready to fire at the approaching creature!

To fire your laser gun: press the fire button while you move the Joystick
either left or right, depending on the direction in which you wish to fire.
You cannot fire up or down.

If you're in a tight spot and can't seem to fire your way out, you can activate
the laser flash.  Just hold down the fire button while you move the Joystick
up.  The laser flash will cause all the creatures on the screen to disappear...
just long enough for you to escape.  You'll start with three flashes, so use 
them wisely!

Pick up Treasure.  Various kinds of exotic and priceless treasures are located
throughout the maze.  You'll find them tucked away in alcoves.  Just remember
that you don't have to go after each one--especially if it's too risky.  As the
astute archeologist knows, some treasures are more valuable than others. (The
list is on p. 7.)  It's up to you to decide which ones you most desire.  Good
luck.

Find the Secret Passageways.  Secret passageways let you zip from one side of
the chamber to the other.  They can let you escape dangerous situations.
Oftentimes it's the only way to continue through the maze.  Because a secret is
a secret, it's up to you to find out where each one is located.

Watch the Time Band.  The time band monitors the amount of ammunition in your
laser gun.  The longer you remain in the maze, the faster the ammo is used up.
So try to complete the maze as quickly as you can.  Your ammo supply replenishes
with each new chamber.

Open the Door.  At the end of each maze, you'll find a door.  As long as the
archeologist has the key in hand, he'll unlock that door when he reaches it.
Behind it lies another fabulous treasure and the entrance to the next
chamber!  If the archeologist has no key when he reaches the door, he must go
back and get it.

END OF GAME

The game ends when you've lost the last of your three "lives."  To play again
at the same level, press RESET.

LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY

There are four levels of difficulty.  Each level is comprised of the four
different chambers.  If you complete the four chambers of Level One with at
least one remaining "life," you'll proceed to the first chamber of Level Two.
If you complete the four chambers of Level Two with at least one remaining
"life," you'll proceed to the first chamber of Level Three, and so on.  Complete
all four chambers of Level Four, and you'll repeat Level One.

THE CHAMBERS

As you forge deeper into the tomb, you'll see that inside each chamber is a
different maze, each one a bit more difficult than the last; different
treasures; and different creatures...

tombs

Palm fan...used to keep Queen Nefretiti cool

Crystal...believed to be from the glass furnaces of Thebes

Blue Zircon...very rare...favorite jewel of Queen Nefertari, wife of Ramses II

Behind the unlocked door lies the most coveted treasure of all...the death
mask of Tutankham, himself!
