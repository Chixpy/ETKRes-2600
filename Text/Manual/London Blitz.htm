<p align="center"><strong>INSTRUCTIONS </strong></p>

<p>During World War II, German bombs turned daily existence in London into a nightmare.
Hoping to undermine the strong spirit of the British, every night the Germans dropped
bombs on the citizens of London. Mast bombs exploded on impact, but some would sit
minutes, hours, or days before detonating. It was up to the British Army Royal Engineers
to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXBs). There were many types of UXBs and the
engineers had to learn each. The bombs did have some things in common: they required sharp
thinking, delicate treatment, and split-second timing. in LONDON BLITZ you are assigned to
the Royal Engineers and are tasked to keep your sector of London free of bombs. There are
several types of bombs, each requiring special skills which you had better learn.
Excellent performance will be rewarded by promotions, but damaged property may get you
'busted.' There are three ways for you to get out of this nasty business: 

<ol>
  <li>Be removed from the service for incompetence [busted below Lance Corporal].</li>
  <li>Receive a posthumously awarded Victoria Cross, or</li>
  <li>Be promoted to the rank of Captain where you can turn your attention to administrative
    details. </li>
</ol>

<p align="center"><strong>GETTING STARTED</strong></p>

<p>To play LONDON BLITZ, insert the game cartridge, label up, into your game system. Be
sure that a joystick is plugged into either of the controller jacks. When you turn the
game on, the letters 'AH' will be displayed against a blue background. Select the joystick
you will use by briefly pressing its fire button. Now select your initial rank [level of
difficulty] by moving the joystick up or down until the desired rank is displayed. Your
rank determines the difficulty of the bombs assigned to you for disposal. As you progress
in skill you can start at a higher rank. When you have selected the initial rank you
desire [Lance Corporal through First Lieutenant], briefly press the fire button to start
the game. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>GETTING AROUND </strong></p>

<p>The blue and green street map displays your assigned sector of London. Your position is
displayed by a red cross. The positions of any reported bombs are flashed on the screen in
white. To view your entire sector, scroll the map up or down by pushing the joystick in
that direction. You cannot move to the bomb while looking at the map, but you will find it
helpful to give yourself instructions to the bomb. For example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Face left, move to the second street on the right, turn right, go as far as you can go,
  and turn left.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can move any combination of up, down, left, or right movements, but you cannot move
diagonally. When you are ready to move to a bomb, briefly press the fire button. You can
move while viewing the street. You can see the square you are in and several directly
ahead of you in the direction you are facing. The white arrow serves as a compass showing
which way you are looking on the map. Use it should you lose your sense of direction. To
change the direction you are facing, without moving, push the joystick left or right to
turn in that direction. Note the change in the direction of the arrow. The joystick is
very sensitive and will turn you very quickly. This may make control a little difficult
for you at first, but will be very helpful once you have had some practice moving on the
streets. To advance in the direction you are facing or retreat [without turning around]
push the joystick up or down. To view the map again, briefly press the fire button when
you are in any square <strong>not occupied by a bomb</strong>. You can only see bombs that
are directly ahead of you. To examine or disarm a bomb, advance to the square containing
the bomb and briefly press the fire button. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>THE BOMBS </strong></p>

<p>The three type of bombs you will encounter are very similar in appearance. Starting at
the top of the mechanism there are three sliding bars. All the bars will initially be to
the far right. The top and bottom bar have six positions from left to right. The middle
bar has four positions. <strong>The color of the slides Indicates the type of bomb: green,
blue, or orange</strong>. Below the three slides are three indicator lights. The
indicators are only valid <strong>after </strong>you have made an attempt at disarming the
bomb. Below the three indicators is the timer showing a red line against a green or yellow
background. The red line moves from right to left, showing the amount of time left before
the bomb detonates. When the slower green timer runs out the bomb shifts to a fast yellow
timer. If you are working on a bomb when it shifts to the yellow timer, you must disarm it
or perish. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>DISARMING INSTRUCTIONS, PAY ATTENTION!</strong></p>

<p>All the bombs are similar in that in order to disarm the bomb, you must match a three
digit combination by properly positioning the three slides. The duration of the bomb's
timer and the number of combinations you can try before the bomb's anti-tampering fuse
will detonate it vary according to your rank when the bomb was dropped. The higher your
rank, the shorter the bomb's timer and fewer the number of attempts allowed to disarm the
bomb before it detonates. There is no visual indication of the number of attempts allowed
or taken--you must keep track of that yourself. Once a bomb has started on its short
(yellow) fuse, you cannot run clear of its blast and must attempt to disarm it. When you
are a First Lieutenant, the bombs are rigged so that any attempt to disarm them
immediately sets off the short (yellow) timer. The short timer last 33 seconds. You had
better be good! </p>

<p>All the bombs are similar in appearance except for the color of the three slides. The
slide color indicates the type of bomb. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>THE BASIC BOMB (GREEN SLIDES)</strong></p>

<p>The bomb with the green slides is the simplest bomb to defuse. When you first see the
bomb, the three green slides will be to the far right. Anytime you switch from the street
scene to the bomb, the accuracy of the three indicators is uncertain. To set a combination
into the bomb, move the joystick up or down until the slide you desire to change is shown
white instead of green. Now move the joystick left or right until the slide is in the
desired position. Move the joystick up or down and set the other slides to different
positions if desired.</p>

<p>When all three slides are in the position you desire, test your combination by moving
the joystick up or down until all three slides are green. Now briefly move the joystick
left or right until your hear a beep. Each beep you hear registers one attempt to defuse
the bomb. Be careful not to hold the joystick to the side longer than necessary and waste
some of your tries. When you hear the beep, the indicator lights will change to reflect
the accuracy of your attempted combination. The indicators will not change until you
attempt another combination or until you leave the bomb. Should you return to the street
scene, the bomb remembers the positions of the slides and the number of attempts you made,
but will not remember the status of the indicator lights. The indicator lights will be
red, black, or green. The left indicator corresponds to the top slide, the middle to the
middle slide, and the right indicator to the bottom slide. <strong>If the Indicator Is
black, It Indicates that the corresponding slide is correctly positioned. If the slide Is
red, It Indicates that the slide should be moved Jo the left. If the slide Is green, the
corresponding slide needs to be moved to the right.</strong> </p>

<p>When you have positioned all three slides correctly and test the combination, you will
disarm the bomb. You will hear a high pitched tone and be returned to the street scene.
The bomb will have disappeared. Should you desire to leave the bomb prior to disarming it,
press the fire button and you will return to the street scene. You cannot leave the bomb
if it has begun its fast (yellow) timer. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>THE AUTOMATIC BOMB (BLUE SLIDE)</strong></p>

<p>The automatic bomb is similar to the basic bomb except that you do not move the slides.
The bomb will automatically cycle through sixteen [always the same] combinations. One of
these combinations is the correct one. Your task is to test the proper one. The key to
solving the automatic bomb is to remember the position of the slides when you make a
disarming attempt. To attempt disarming, push the joystick to the left or right briefly
until you hear the beep. Remember that the indicators are not accurate when you first see
the bomb. The indicator lights will change to reflect the accuracy of the combination <strong>that
was displayed</strong> <strong>when you moved the joystick</strong>, and will not change
until you test another combination. The indicators correspond to the same slides as those
in the basic bomb. If you remember the positions of the slides and use the indicators, you
can make your next choice of combination more intelligently. It is particularly helpful if
you happen to chose a combination with one of the slides in the correct position giving
you a black indicator. This is easy to spot and tells you to try only combinations that
have that particular slide in the same position. As with the basic bomb, you can leave the
bomb any time while it is still on its long (green) timer by pressing the fire button. If
you disarm the bomb, you will hear the high pitched tone and will be returned to the
street scene. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>THE RANDOM INDICATOR BOMB (ORANGE SLIDE)</strong> </p>

<p>The random indicator bomb is identical to the basic bomb except for the positioning of
the indicator lights. With the basic bomb the left slide corresponded to the top slide,
the middle to the middle, and the right indicator to the bottom slide. With the random
indicator bomb, the relative positions of the indicators may be in any order...
Top-Middle-Bottom... Top-Bottom-Middle ... Bottom-Top-Middle... Middle-Bottom-Top... etc.
The sequence will not change for any one bomb and all slides will be represented by an
indicator. It may be helpful to move only one slide for each attempt until you have
identified which indicator corresponds to each slide. When you disarm the bomb, you will
hear a high pitched tone, the bomb will disappear, and you will find yourself back on the
street to tackle another bomb</p>

<p align="center"><strong>WINNING, LOSING, SCORING</strong></p>

<p>Should you take too many incorrect attempts at disarming any of the bombs, or happen to
be in the same square with the bomb when the timer runs out, the bomb will
detonate--terminating the game. You get credit for bombs you disarm, and are penalized for
bombs which detonate. In order to be promoted, you must disarm more bombs than you allow
to detonate. Failure to disarm enough bombs will lead to being busted. There are eight
levels within any rank. You will be advanced one level for disarming a basic bomb (green
slides), two levels for an automatic bomb (blue slides), and three levels for a random
indicator bomb (orange slides).</p>

<p>Your level within your rank will be indicated by a bar displayed beneath your rank
insignia. Your rank without a bar indicates the lowest level. A bar the full width of your
rank insignia indicates the highest level within your rank. Your final rank is displayed
against a black screen when the game ends. No intermediate level is shown. The game will
end when you get promoted to Captain, when you would be busted below Lance Corporal, or
when you have a fatal meeting with a bomb. Should the last occur, your rank will be the
highest rank you were promoted out of. For example--if you started as a Lance Corporal,
worked your way up to Warrant Officer, were then busted to Sergeant and were killed at
this rank, your final rank would be Staff Sergeant. If you started at Second Lieutenant
and were blown up before being promoted, your final rank would be Lance Corporal as you
never earned your initial rank! </p>

<p align="center"><strong>CONSOLE SWITCHES </strong></p>

<p>You can restart any game, at any time, by pressing the RESET button on the game
console. After a game is completed you may start a new game by pressing the fire button
once (the letters 'AH' will appear on the screen] and then pressing EITHER joystick fire
button to start a new game. This sequence allows another player to play LONDON BLITZ
without having to reach for the console control switches. The console switches other than
the POWER On/Off switch and the RESET switch are not used. <strong>GET BUSY. GOD SAVE THE
KING! </strong></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>BOARD GAMES... </strong></em></font></p>

<p><strong>SQUAD LEADER</strong>--Russian, American, and German forces engage in bloody
street fights, descend on enemy held villages, take key hills, or cross open fields in the
quintessence of infantry combat. A game that recreates every aspect of infantry warfare
from the house-to-house fighting in Stalingrad to armored advances across snow-covered
roads in the Ardennes. The underlying theme of SQUAD LEADER is one hinged on morale.
Leaders play a major role by directing fire, rallying broken units, and generally
enhancing the performance of their troops. The player who can direct his leaders the most
effectively will usually be the winner. Nothing is certain though and SQUAD LEADER
contains the unpredictable nature of men and machines which is both the blessing and bane
of commanders. </p>

<p><strong>CIVILIZATION </strong>is a game unlike any other game ever invented.., a game
of high-level player interaction with no dice and little risk of any player being
eliminated. The object of the game is to gain a level of overall advancement to which
cultural, economic, and political factors are important. The winner is the player who
maintains the best balance between activities of nomads, farmers, citizens, merchants and
adventurers. </p>

<p><strong>DIPLOMACY</strong>--For seven players [with special rules for two-six players],
this is a game of political power, shifting alliances, back-stabbing and psychological
intimidation. Each player represents one of the seven pre-World War I major
powers--Germany, Austria, Hungary, Turkey, Russia, Italy, England, and France. The game is
a series of &quot;negotiation periods,&quot; where players try to out-wit and out-talk
their opponents. To win, one country must control half of the mapboard which portrays
Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. </p>

<p><strong>TACTICS II</strong>--The hobby of wargaming was born in the late 50's with the
inception of Avalon Hill's TACTICS. Now a direct descendant, TACTICS II is an outstanding
introductory game for potential hobby members. The armies in the game are equal. Victory
will be gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in
military strategy and tactics. Game features include special functions for headquarters
units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements,
isolation, and even nuclear weapons. </p>

<p><strong>FACTS IN FIVE </strong>combines the elegance of simplicity and the excitement
of competition with memory, general knowledge and an interest in trivia. The game pits
players against time, themselves, and each other. In each round, players select five
classes and a category in each class, selected from over one thousand choices of popular
and academic subjects. Special rules allow children of all ages to compete on an even
basis with adults. </p>

<p><strong>ACQUIRE </strong>is a game for two to six players that takes you into the world
of hotels. Players must start hotel chains and then expand them by building more and more
hotels around them. At the same time, players may buy stock in any active chains, even
those begun by other players. The players with the most stock in a chain, control that
chain. They will then try to make a profit by merging this chain with other chains,
because the major stockholders receive bonuses during mergers. Luck will play its part,
but the winner will be the player who has had the foresight to buy the right stock at the
right time. </p>

<p><strong>STATIS-PRO BASEBALL </strong>comes with &quot;stat cards&quot; representing
every player of every big league team that performed regularly in the previous season.
That's more than 700 individual cards! Statistically accurate in hitting, pitching,
fielding! Each Player Card--whether the mightiest superstar or a little-used
reserve--contains information depicting on-the-field performances in every department.
Avalon Hill has computer-analyzed season-long statistics for each player's hitting,
fielding, pitching, base-stealing, bunting, game-winning hits, even stamina ... converting
it all to &quot;FAST ACTION&quot; results. It's our guarantee that each player should
perform in this game just as he does in real life! </p>

<p><strong>PAYDIRT</strong>--NOW is the time to get hold of the Sports Illustrated Pro
Football Game. We have scouted all 28 pro teams. We've determined their strengths and
weaknesses on offense, defense, and special teams. And we've converted all this
