GAME DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Here's your home version of the fun-filled Exidy arcade game!  MOUSE
        TRAP(tm) for Atari features a cheese-chomping mouse that you dash 
        around a dangerous maze.  Open and shut maze doors to escape the 
        pursuing cats.  Eat a bone, then turn your mouse into a cat-biting dog
        for a few moments.  Gather points by eating the cheeses that line the 
        paths of the maze.  Devour them all and move on to even harder action!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GETTING READY TO PLAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        * Make sure the Video Computer System(tm) is connected to the TV and 
          the power adapter switch is plugged in.
        * Be sure the B-W/Color switch is set to the &quot;Color&quot; position.

          To play a fun game variation, Invivsible Maze MOUSE TRAP(tm), set the
          B-W/Color switch to &quot;B-W&quot;.  This variation features the same game play
          as MOUSE TRAP(tm), but the maze, cheeses and bones are invisible.

        * Be sure you have plugged a joystick controller into the left jack at
          the rear of the Video Computer System(tm).

        * Insert cartridge as shown, then turn On/Off switch ON.
          (ALWAYS TURN THE ON/OFF SWITCH TO OFF WHEN INSERTING OR REMOVING A
          CARTRIDGE.)

        correctly inserted into the VCS, Label side UP.)]

Watch out for the pursuing cats! Open and close maze doors to block their paths. Become an expert at pressing the Red Button for just the right amount of time to foil their chase. STEP 4: Dog gone it! Are the cats ganging up on you? Get your revenge! Your mouse can become a cat-biting dog if it has eaten a bone. Check the Bones Remaining Indicator. (Notice that the mouse has already eaten one bone at game start.) If you have a bone, press the Red Button for just the right short period to turn your mouse into a cat-biting dog for a few happy moments. Remember, each time you change your mouse into a dog, you use up one bone. So eat more bones and save them up for emergencies. But be careful. You can save only up to four bones at a time. The game ends when all your mice have been eliminated. _____________ | SCORING |----------------------------- | | | Eating a cheese: 1 point | | Biting a cat: 10 points | | Clearing the maze: 100 points | You get three mice at game start. Each time your score reaches a multiple of 500, you earn a bonus mouse.
