<strong>STORY OF MALAGAI</strong><br>
<br>
You are Harrington 'Harry' Crag, commander of the starship &quot;Endless Search&quot;.<br>
<br>
You have landed on a MALAGAI starbase to make emergency repairs to your ship.&nbsp; The
repairs are now complete but the MALAGAI are holding you for ransom...they need the
secrets of your advanced civilization!!! You are allowed to roam about the ship as long as
you are not away from your compartment too long and you do not try to escape. Your ship is
located outside a series of three airlocks. The key to each airlock is held by one of the
MALAGAI. You must catch the MALAGAI in the order shown at the top of the screen and get to
the airlock before being captured. If you take too long, or catch the wrong MALAGAI,
returning to your compartment will make the MALAGAI friendly again and give you another
chance for escape.<br>
<br>
<strong>GAME INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br>
<br>
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to connect your Atari 2600 or compatible video
game system to your television set.<br>
<br>

both difficulty switches to the &quot;A&quot; position.<br>
<br>
3. Game select switch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) There are three game strategy levels. Game level 1 is the easiest, level 3
the hardest.<br>

<br>
4. Hold the joystick with the red button in the upper left position.<br>
<br>
5. Starting the game:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) If there is no game in progress, press the red button on the joystick. If
there is a game in progress and you wish to start over, press game reset on the console.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Observe the three MALAGAI displayed above the maze. The leftmost figure
indicates which MALAGAI has the first key. The center figure indicates who has the second
key, and the rightmost figure indicates who has the third and final key. When you are
ready move the joystick to start the action.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) When you exit from one starbase level and enter the next, or lose a crew
member, no action will take place until you move the joystick.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If there are two players, the players rotate when the current player loses
a crew member. As before - actions begin when you move the joystick.<br>

<p><font face="Verdana">9. Game is over when all your crew members have been destroyed by
the MALAGAI or you exit from the third starbase into the infinite reaches of space.<br>
<br>
<strong>MALAGAI STRATEGY LEVELS</strong><br>
<br>
LEVEL 1:<br>
All three MALAGAI have different shapes and colors. When you capture a MALAGAI the
airlocks at the top of the screen will blink if you have the right key.<br>
<br>
LEVEL 2:<br>
All three MALAGAI have the same shape but different colors.<br>
<br>
LEVEL 3:<br>
FOR EXPERTS ONLY!!! MALAGAI are the same shape and same color - and the airlocks and
compartment WILL NOT BLINK!!!<br>
<br>
<strong>STRATEGY HINTS FOR HIGH SCORING</strong><br>
<br>
* When you are trying to catch a MALAGAI they will run from you. You can use this to your
advantage by &quot;herding&quot; them towards the airlocks to increase your chances of
reaching the airlocks before being captured.<br>
<br>
* After you have captured a MALAGAI, they will begin to chase you. You may have to lead
them away from your true destination temporarily to get them out of the immediate vicinity
of the airlocks or compartment.<br>
<br>
* Keep your eye on the time line at the bottom of the screen. If you are running out of
time, return to your compartment quickly so as not to lose a crewmember - and you will
regain additional time.<br>
<br>
* When you capture (make contact on the screen) a MALAGAI, immediately point the joystick
in the direction you wish to go in order to reach the airlock in time - you are only
allowed a small head start and if you take too long you will be captured immediately!<br>
<br>
<strong>GOOD LUCK!!!</strong></font></p>
