TEST PILOT LOG MARCH 17, 2093:  On what started to be the routine high speed
test of interplanetary craft Delta 12, a powerplant malfunction caused the
craft to skip off the rim of a smmall, black hole.  After experiencing
level 5 turbulence I became unconsciouss.  Upon awaking, I found myself in a
time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed.

The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought
waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally
insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body
parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical
parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire
society composed of machines.

During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of
the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the
expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After
the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began
attacking the good creatures.

Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot
the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the
best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should 
prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines 
programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be 
awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  
To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the 
last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.  They have 
warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is 
constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.

				GAME FEATURES

FIREFLY by Mythiiicon offers tremendous variety in the types of enemies you,
as Firefly, will encounter.  By continually moving from one screen to the 
next you are actually playing several games in one.  Each enemy moves 
differently and requires different skills of the game player.

The first challenge is to rescue the pixy.  While appearing easy, be cautius 
of the enemy bee.  He is very good at determining where you are and his 
sting is deadly.  Should you survive and rescue the pixy, you are faced 
with the flaming pumpkin.  He is so hot that merely touching him will be 
fatal.  He also has an unlimited supply of deadly pumpkin seeds to fire at 
you.  The next screen brings you to the true meanness of the demons.  Their 
touch and cannon shots are to be avoided at all cost.  The bats will be 
waiting should the unlikely occur and you survive.  The bad bugs aren't 
worried, however, since ythey have a sun full of shooting balls of fire 
ready to ruin your day.  If that isn't enough, you can try your luck against 
the coiled serpents.  For the truly talented players who make it through 
this series of Bad-Bug tricks don't worry, they will all be there again for 
your next journey through the land of the Bad-Bugs.

of the enemies are more evil.
