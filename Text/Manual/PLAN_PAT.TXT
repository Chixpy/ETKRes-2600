OBJECT OF GAME

Your assignment is to patrol your planet day and night.
As you fly your space craft you must avoid enemy fire and
destroy their spaceships. Don't forget to refuel
occasionally or this could make your mission a short one.
Beware of sunset because as soon as the night creeps in,
the dark makes your task become impossible.

FUNCTIONS
* To start, press SELECT to set level then press RESET
* Move joystick up and down to move your white spaceship.
* Fire at orange enemy ships, using firing button.
* Dock with black ship, this will allow you to land later
  and refuel.
* Enemy refuelling depot. There are 3 of these, you must
  destroy them before you can continue to next stage.
* Mine fields - these follow immediately after the
  destruction of the fuel depot. You can't fire at them,
  the only thing you can do is dodge them.

HINT
