VIDEO GAME INSTRUCTIONS




<big><b>GAME SCENARIO</b></big>
Surf's Up and you're ready to go. But wait ..... there's a Shark warning.
The only thing to do is jump each time a Shark makes his move. Not easy
when you're riding on top of a wild, pulsating wave. Any mistakes and into
the water you go.

Under the thundering surf youfind an old sunken Galleon between you
and your surfboard. you only have a few seconds of air to negotiate the
distance. The Galleon is protected by a fast moving Octopus. The walls of
the Galleon can change shape and just in case you're not too busy, there's
a Jellyfish standing guard by your surfboard. Make it back on time and get
another ride on the Wild Surf.

The action gets faster and faster. You test every skill you know plus invent
a few new ones, but ride the Wild Surf you will .....


<b><big>SETTING UP</b></big>
Always insert cartridge with console power off.

Securely connect left joystick. Hold joystick with &quot;Jump&quot; (&quot;Fire&quot;) button
on upper left hand corner as shown.

When power to the game console is turned on, the first scene of the
game will be displayed on the TV screen. Two numbers will appear on
the upper left hand corner. The left number, which will be zero at
the start of play, is the scoring clock. As long as the surfer is success-
fully riding the waves, this number will increase. the right number,
which starts at one, tells the player which game level will be played.


<b>Game Select Switch</b>
The player can select any one of four starting levels by depressing game
select switch. If the game select switch is depressed and held down, the
level selection will cycle automatically. The higher the level, the more
difficult the game.


<b>Left Difficulty Switch</b>
the object of the first part of the game is to keep the surfer as close as
possible to the top (crest) of the moving wave. Some error is allowable.
With the left difficulty switch in the &quot;A&quot; (or novice) position, this error is
greater than the &quot;B&quot; (or expert) position so the game is easier in the &quot;A&quot;
position.


<b>Right Difficulty Switch</b>
The game is normally played in the &quot;A&quot; (or novice) position. In the &quot;B&quot;
(or expert) position the shape of the ship will change while the surfer is
underwater. Be carefull for this is very tricky and difficult to get through
successfully.


<b>TV Type Switch</b>
The switch can be used to stop the game (time out) at any time by placing
it in the B-W (black and white) position. To continue game play return the
switch to the color position. (The game will always play in color on a color
TV set)


<b><big>PLAYING</b></big>
To start the game press the button on the joystick (or the game start
switch on the console). By moving the joystick as shown, try to keep the
surfer as close to the top of the wave as possible.

Shark Attack - At various times the shark will swim towards the surfer.
Just before the shark comes in contact with the surfer, press the button on
the joystick to jump the surfer over the shark. He will then go away (for a
while). If the shark strikes the surfer, the surfer will be thrown into the
water and the TV picture will change to an underwater scene.

When the surfer is underwater you must move the figure through the
sunken galleon while avoiding an attacking octopus and position the figure
close to the surfboard which is floating and moving on the water on the top
right side of the scene. Beware of the jellyfish that is located under the
surfboard. If the figure comes in contact with any underwater creature you
will lose a turn. The number of turns you have left is the number at the right
of the score which becomes active once the game starts. You can also lose
a turn by being underwater too long. If you lose a turn while underwater,
or you successfully return to the surfboard, the surfer will then appear
riding the wave again. There are two different shaped ships under the
water. Their shapes will change every other time the surfer enters the
water.


<b><big>SCORING</b></big>
The scoring timer will cycle only when the surfer is riding the wave. The
higher the numbers, the more skillfull the player.

Bonus - You will receive an extra turn for every 1,000 points scored.

</table>

<b><big>HELPFULL HINTS</b></big>
The wave and underwater creatures will move faster as your score increases.

When underwater you may find it easier to enter and go through the
sunken ship by waiting at the ship's entrance until the first octopus leaves
the ship. Be careful - the surfer can only stay underwater for a limited
time.

Have fun, good luck and look out for other challenging VIDEO GEMS games.
