MODEL CX2616



Use your Joystick Controllers with this ATARI&reg; Game Program&trade;. Be sure the
controllers are firmly plugged into the <b>LEFT</b> and <b>RIGHT CONTROLLER</b> jacks at the
rear of your ATARI Video Computer System&trade;. Hold the Joystick with the red button
to your upper left toward the television screen.

For one-player games, use the controller plugged into the <b>LEFT CONTROLLER</b>
jack. See Section 3 of your Video Computer System Owner's Manual for details.

<b>NOTE:</b> Always turn the console <b>power</b> switch <b>off</b> when inserting or removing a
Game Program. This will protect the electronic components and prolong the life of
your ATARI Video Computer System.

<b><big><big>1. MEET THE ATARI COMPUTER SOCCER TEAM</b></big></big>

Okay, soccer fans, the ATARI CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER&trade; Team
challenges you to a game. The ATARI computer team is waiting
impatiently inside your Game Program cartridge for you to select
one of the single player games (Games 28 through 54). They
want to show you their stuff. Here's a brief rundown on each
player, just so you'll know who you're up against.

<b>&quot;CRASH&quot; MORGAN</b> the galloping goalie, is the fastest
man on the team. &quot;CRASH&quot; got his nickname because he
is forever slamming into the goal posts chasing after the
ball. Fortunately, the goal posts are never damaged, but
sometimes you can score a goal on him before his ears
stop ringing.

<b>NICK DANGER</b>, the frantic forward, is mean and nasty
and just loves to blast the ball into your goal shouting, &quot;eat
leather, chump.&quot; Don't let his bad manners bother you, it's
just his way of rattling the opposition.

<b>&quot;LUMPY&quot; DURAN</b>, the left back, is without a doubt the
clumsiest player in the world of soccer. Penalized twice for
stepping on the ball instead of kicking it, he was finally thrown
out of one game for toe-kicking the referee!

<b>ALEXIE PUTSNOWSKI</b> (Putsy), the right back. What can we say
about Putsy? A real ladies man, a great soccer player, a sore
loser. Even though &quot;The Puts&quot; has kicked and gouged his way
to soccer stardom, for three years in a row he has been
voted the &quot;least likely&quot; player.


<b><big><big>2. CHOOSING A GAME</b></big></big>

Reading the GAME SELECT MATRIX

Select your game number from the GAME SELECT MATRIX
(Section 10). The matrix describes each of the 54
games in CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER. Games 1 through 27
are two-player games. Games 28 through 54 are single-player
games against the computer.

<b>Two-player Games</b>
The GAME SELECT MATRIX describes two-player games in
terms of how fast the teams move (Team Speed), how wide
the goals are (Goal Size), and what the out-of-bounds
penalties are (Penalties) if penalties apply.

Some two-player games have no out-of-bounds penalties
(Penalties N in the GAME SELECT MATRIX). In these
games the ball rebounds from boundaries (sidelines and goal
lines). In other two-player games the ball rebounds from
goal lines but there is a penalty if the ball crosses  a sideline
(Penalties S). In the remaining two-player games there are
penalties, if the ball crosses either a sideline or a goal line
(Penalties SG). For a description of the penalty plays, see
Section 5-OUT-OF-BOUNDS PENALTY PLAYS.

The easiest two-player game is Game 1. The teams move
slowly (S), there are no penalties (N), and the goals are
large (L). The most difficult two-player game is probably
Game 27, with fast teams (F), out-of-bounds penalties (SG),
and small goals (S).

<b>Single-Player Games</b>
There are no penalties in single-player games. The GAME
SELECT MATRIX describes the games in terms of how fast
the teams move (Team Speed), how wide the goals are (Goal
Size), and how hard the computer is to beat (Computer
Difficulty). Game 28 is probably the easiest single-player
game, since team speed is slow (S), the computer is easy to
beat(E), and the goal are large (L). Game 54 is the hardest.
Teams move fast (F), the computer is difficult to beat (D),
and goals are small (S).

<b>Selecting the Game Number</b>
Once you have selected your game from the GAME
SELECT MATRIX, press down the game select switch on
your ATARI Video Computer System until the game number
comes up on the game number counter. The counter is at
top left of your television screen (see Figure 1).

<b>NOTE:</b> To advance the game numbers faster, hold the game
reset switch down together with the game select switch.


<b><big><big>3. HOW TO PLAY CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER</b></big></big>

<b>Object of the game</b>
The object is to score points by kicking the ball into your
opponent's goal. One point is scored for each goal. The
scores are shown at the top of your television screen. The left
player's score is at the top left; the right player's score, or the
computer's score, is at top right (see Figure 2).

<b>Team Moves</b>
Each team consists of three fielders (a Forward and two
Backs) and a goalkeeper. The fielders are controlled by the
Joystick and always move together in whatever direction
you move the Joystick: up, down, right, left, or diagonally
(see Figure 3).

The goalkeeper moves from side to side within his goal
area. While the ball is in play, the computer moves the
goalkeeper and keeps him in front of the ball. You can make
him move faster by moving your Joystick left and right.
When the goalkeeper takes possession of the ball, you
control his moves with the Joystick.

<b>Ball Skills</b>
Specific ball skills are described in Section 7-BALL CONTROL.
In general, use the Joystick to direct the ball;
press the red button to pass and kick the ball. See Section
8-GAME STRATEGY for offensive and defensive plays.

<b>NOTE:</b> Some people say they can move the teams more
easily and react faster if they keep their right thumb on the
Joystick and their left thumb on the red button. This technique
might work for you too.

<b>The Referee</b>
The black lines you see on the left side of your television
screen are the referee and the linesmen who assist him (see
Figure 4). The referee blows the whistle to start and stop
play and positions the ball for kickoffs and penalty plays.

<b>The Clock</b>
A game of CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER is played in two
halves. A half lasts from 3 to 5 minutes, depending on the
Team Speed of the game you select. The clock at top center
of your television screen (see Figure 2) starts counting down
the seconds to the end of the first half when you press down
the game reset switch on your ATARI Video Computer System.

There is no time-out between halves. As soon as the clock
counts down the first half, it resets and starts counting
down the second half. The referee's whistle signals both
the end of the first half and the start of the second.

<b>The Opening Kickoff</b>
At the start of the game, the ball is placed on the center
spot and the two teams line up on either side of the centerline
(see Figure 4). The Red team (or dark team if your game is in
black-and white) is controlled by the left Joystick. The Blue
team (or light team) is controlled by the right Joystick in
two-player games and by the computer in single-player games.

<b>NOTE:</b> The team color may vary with the color settings of
your television set. For example, the Red team may appear
to be orange or pink.

The Forward of the Red team kicks off. The kickoff is a kick
backward to one of the team Backs. Move the left Joystick
diagonally back left or right to make the kickoff (see Figure
4). You do net need to press the red button to make a
kickoff, but you can kick faster if you move the Joystick and
then quickly press the button.

<b>The Play</b>
After the opening kickoff the Red team (the attacking team)
dribbles and kicks the ball toward the Blue team's goal
The Blue team (the defending team) attempts to steal the ball
and attack the Red team's goal. In CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER
the defending team has an advantage because it moves faster
than the attacking team.

When an attacking team is within range of the opponent's
goal, the attackers attempt to kick the ball past the
goalkeeper into the goal. If the goalkeeper catches the ball
and blocks the kick, he attempts to kick the ball upfield
to a teammate. The attackers try to intercept and make their
goal.

<b>Scoring</b>
To score a goal you must kick the ball completely into the
goal, as shown in Figure 5. The ball cannot touch the goal
line or stop partway into the goal.

<b>NOTE:</b> If the ball stops on the goal line in front of the goal or
partway into the goal, the goalkeeper will &quot;trap&quot; it
(gather the ball in).

When a team makes a goal and scores a point, the ball is
placed on the center spot, and the Forward of the team that
did not score kicks off to one of the team Backs. The play
continues until the clock runs out and the first half ands.

<b>The Second Half</b>
At the half the teams switch sides. The Forward of the Blue
team (light-colored team) kicks off to one of the team Backs to
start the play.


<b><big><big>4. LIMITS OF TEAM PLAY</b></big></big>

<b>Horizontal Limits</b>
If your Forward is playing the ball close to a sideline, one of
your Backs will be over the sideline. This is perfectly legal
in all games, including games with sidelines out of bounds.

<b>Vertical Limits</b>
Teams can approach the goal line close enough to trap the
ball but they cannot cross the goal lines.


<b><big><big>5.OUT-OF-BOUNDS PENALTY PLAYS</b></big></big>

Each time an out-of-bounds infraction takes place,the
referee blows his whistle. The team against which the penalty
is called then flashes as a sign that it forfeits the ball and
cannot touch it. One of three penalty plays results: The
Throw-In, The Goal Line Kick, or The Corner Kick.

<b>The Throw-In</b>
The Throw-In penalty play results when a team drives the
ball over a sideline. At the point the ball went out of
bounds, it is thrown in to a fielder on the other team. To
receive a throw-in, carefully move your receiver up to the
ball and barely touch it (see Figure 6). The ball will jump
from the sideline and your receiver will trap it. The ball is
back in play as soon as the throw-in is completed.

<b>The Goal Line Kick</b>
When an attacking team maneuvers the ball over the
defending team's goal line, the referee calls a penalty against
the attacking team. The referee places the ball on the goal line
in front of the defending team's goalkeeper, and the goalkeeper
traps the ball (see Figure 7). He then kicks it upfield to a
teammate. The kick can be intercepted by the attacking
team, since the ball is back in play as soon as the goalkeeper
kicks it.

<b>The Corner Kick</b>
If the defending team maneuvers the ball outside its
own goal line, the referee calls a penalty against the defending
team. the referee places the ball in the corner close to the
defending team's goal, and the  attacking team kicks it upfield
to a teammate. the defending team cannot intercept the ball
until after the attacking team has touched it or it has rolled
to a stop.

To make the corner kick, position the attacking team to
receive the ball, then press the button on your Joystick. The
ball will sail out of the corner at a 45-degree angle as long
as you hold the button in. If you release the button, the ball
will cut across in front of the goal line, at which time you
can attempt to kick a goal (see Figure 8). For tips on how to
score on a corner kick, see Section 8-GAME STRATEGY.


<b><big><big>6. CONSOLE CONTROLS</b></big></big>

<b>Game Select Switch</b>
Use the game select switch to select a game number. The
game number appears at the top left of your television
screen. The number at the top right tells you whether the
game is for one or two players.

See Section 10-GAME SELECT MATRIX for a breakdown
of the 54 games in CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER.

<b>Game Reset Switch</b>
Use the game reset switch to start or restart a game.

<b>Difficulty Switches</b>
Games are normally played with the left and right difficulty
switches set to <b>b</b>. However, if you want to give yourself a
handicap, set your difficulty switch to <b>a</b>. This will enlarge
your goal, making it easier for your opponent to penetrate. If
you have the right Joystick, set the right difficulty switch to <b>a</b>.
If you have the left Joystick, set the left difficulty switch to <b>a</b>.

<b>TV Type Switch</b>
Set this switch to color if you have a color television set. Set
it to b-w to play the game in black-and-white.


<b><big><big>7. BALL CONTROL</b></big></big>

<b>Dribbling</b>
Dribbling is controlled with the Joystick. Move your team up to
the ball until one of your fielders traps it (see Figure 9).
Then quickly move your Joystick in the direction you want
the ball to go. The ball will move a short distance and
stop, unless it is intercepted before it stops.

<b>IMPORTANT REMINDER:</b>
When sending your fielders after the ball, remember that
you can touch the ball and immediately take off in any
direction. You do not have to go around the ball to establish the
direction you next want to move. Think of it as &quot;touch
and go&quot;.

<b>Kicking</b>
To kick the ball after your player traps it, move your Joystick
in the direction you want the ball to go and press the red
button. The longer you hold the button in, the longer the kick
will be. To avoid kicking the ball in the wrong direction,
always move the Joystick before you press the button. If
you press the button without moving the Joystick, the ball
will be kicked straight upfield or straight downfield, depending
upon whether your player is above or below the ball when
he kicks it.

<b>Toe Kick</b>
The toe kick is fast and powerful and therfore the most
effective way to drive the ball toward the goal. This kick
extends your trapping range, as shown in Figure 10, and
moves the ball downfield very fast. It enables you to
out distance the defending team and keep control on the ball.

To execute a toe kick, move your player within leg range of
the ball, push the Joystick in the direction you want the ball
to go, and press the button. You can use the toe kick while
your team is moving crossfield as well as when it is moving
upfield or downfield.

The toe kick is the best way to kick a goal. If you combine the
toe kick with some goal attack strategy, you may become
unbeatable. See Section 8-GAME STRATEGY for some
tips on effective goal attacks.


<b><big><big>8. GAME STRATEGY</b></big></big>

<b>Maintaining Control Over the Ball</b>
When your team is attacking, you should use evasive moves
to keep control of the ball. Pass the ball from player to
player and dodge and weave around the defending team
from stealing the ball. Since the defending team moves
faster than the attacking team, it can easily intercept the ball
if the ball is simply dribbled and kicked straight down the
field toward the goal. Some exercises to improve dribbling,
passing kicking and other game skills are given in Section
9-DRILLS AND PRACTICE.

<b>Kicking a Goal</b>
A straight kick into the goal will almost always be blocked, since
the goalkeeper is always in front of the ball. You will have
more success if you position your fielders for a diagonal kick.
There are many ways to set up a diagonal kick, but the following
three plays are particularly hard to defend against because
of the element of surprise.

<b>The Forward Attack</b> (Figure 11). The team is centered and
reasonably close to the goal. The Forward is in position to
kick the ball either diagonally right or diagonally left into the
goal.

<b>The Base Attack</b> (Figure 12). The team is positioned close to
the goal and off to one side of it. The Back is centered and in
position to kick the ball diagonally into the goal.

<b>The Relay Zig-Zag</b> (Figure 13). The team is in position for the
Base Attack. The Back kicks the ball on a diagonal to the
Forward, who kicks it on the opposite diagonal into the goal.

<b>Defending Your Goal</b>
The trick of an effective goal defense is to shift your attention
from your fielders to your goalkeeper. Position your
fielders so that they can harass the attackers and help
block goal kicks, but keep your eye on the ball and concentrate
on your goalkeeper. Use your Joystick to increase the
speed of his moves within the goal area.

<b>Turning the Play Around</b>
Even when you are fighting to defend yoour goal and your
attention is on your goalkeeper, be alert for a chance to steal
the ball. If you can steal it, pass it to your goalkeeper.
Remember that as long as he has the ball, you control the
play. Resist the temptation to kick the ball aout to one of your
fielders until you find the right opportunity. Back your fielders
away from the goal line, dodge the attackers, and look  for a
chance to kick the ball to a fileder who can move out fast.
If you are skilled enough, you can drive the ball out to the
centerline before the other team can catch you.

<b>Scoring a Goal on a Corner Kick</b>
There are lots of ways to score a goal on a corner kick. This is
just one example. In all plays of this sort, success depends
upon position, speed and surprise.

Center your Forward as if you were going to make a Forward
Attack on your opponent's goal. Press and hold the button
on your Joystick. As explained previously, the ball will
fly out of the corner at a 45-degree angle. Quickly release
the button, and the ball will cut across the goal line.
When the ball passes in front of your receiver, press the
button on your Joystick and make a giagonal toe kick into the
goal (see Figure 14).

It takes a lot of practice to become a skilled CHAMIONSHIP
SOCCER player. Here are some drills to improve your game:


<b><big><big>9. DRILL AND PRACTICE</b></big></big>

<b>Dribbling and Passing</b>
Play against the computer at a slower speed than you are
used to and practice evasive dribbling and passing.

<b>Kicking a Goal</b>
Play one of the two-player games by yourself. Practice
dribbling up to the goal and executing various goal kicks
that you set up. Practice using the toe kick to kick goals.

<b>Defending the Goal</b>
Play against the computer at a skill level above your own.
Keep the ball in your territory, and the computer will give you
plenty of practice in defending your goal.


<b><big><big>10. GAME SELECT MATRIX</b></big></big>
