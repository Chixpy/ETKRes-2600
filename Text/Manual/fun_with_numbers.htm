<p><font face="Verdana">Use your Joystick Controllers with this Atari Game Program.TM Be
sure the Controllers are firmly plugged into the LEFT and RIGHT CONTROLLER jacks at the
rear of your ATARI Video Computer System.TM See your Owner's Manual for details.<br>
<br>
NOTE: To prolong the life of your ATARI Video Computer System and protect the electronic
components, the Console unit should be OFF when inserting or removing a game program.<br>
<br>
Use the Joystick to make numbers appear on the Blackboard Screen. Push the Joystick
forward to cycle through numbers from 0-9. Push it towards you to make the numbers appear
in decreasing order from 9-0. Use the Joystick Controller to also move the Answer Line.
Move the Joystick to the right and left to move the Answer Line to the right or left.<br>
The red Controller button records your numbers with the Computer Teacher. Press the button
after you have selected answers to the math problem and after you choose problem numbers.<br>
<br>
RIGHT DIFFICULTY SWITCH<br>
<br>
Use this switch to determine if each round (math problem) will be timed. In &quot;A&quot;
position the player has a time limit to produce an answer. In &quot;B&quot; position,
there is no time limit.<br>
<br>
LEFT DIFFICULTY SWITCH<br>
<br>
Use the switch to determine the time limit for each round (math problem).<br>
Games 1-4: With the Difficulty Switch in the &quot;A&quot; position, you have 12 seconds
to record the answer. In &quot;B&quot; position, you have 24 seconds.<br>
<br>
Games 5-8: In &quot;A&quot; position, two digit problems appear with a 24 second time
limit. One digit problems with a 12 second time limit appear when the switch is in
&quot;B&quot; position. (Remember to slide the Right Difficulty Switch to &quot;A&quot;
position first for a timed game.)<br>
<br>
Each game presents 10 math problems. You score one point for each correct answer. At the
end of each game two numbers flash on the screen: the number of total problems, 10, is in
the right hand side, and your score is on the left side.<br>
<br>
Each game features a particular type of math problem. After you select the game you want
to play, a problem will appear on the Blackboard Screen.<br>
<br>
The top number, 7, will be underlined. Push the Joystick forward until you find the number
you want to work with. For example, need some practice on additions using number 8? Just
follow these two steps:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Press the Joystick forward once until number 8 appears as the underlined top number.<br>
2. Then record your number 8 with the Computer Teacher by pressing the red Controller
button.<br>
<br>
NOTE: You will find that sometimes there will be less than 10 problems with the top number
you have selected. When this occurs, the game automatically selects problems from the next
number group.<br>
<br>
<strong>HOW TO RECORD AN ANSWER</strong><br>
<br>
Use your Joystick to show your answer on the screen. Push it forward to cycle through the
consecutive numbers 0-9. Push it towards you to cycle through the numbers in decreasing
order, 9-0. For example, if no number is showing, you can put number 2 on the Blackboard
Screen by:<br>
<br>
- Pushing the Joystick three times - one time for each of the numbers 0, 1 and 2 OR<br>
- Pressing the Joystick forward as the game cycles to number 3. Then release the Joystick.<br>
<br>
After you've selected the kind of problem and number you want to work with, notice the
Answer Line below the math problem on the Blackboard Screen.<br>
<br>
The line equals space for one digit of your answer. You will find that you can move the
Answer Line to the right and left with your Joystick Controller. Just move the Joystick to
the right or left.<br>
<br>
If your answer is more than one digit, you will have to move the Answer Line. For example,
in the above problem, the answer is 15. To record your answer:<br>
<br>
- Select the number 5 with your Joystick. It will appear above the present Answer Line.
The last digit of your answer must always appear on this line.<br>
- Move the Answer Line one digit to the left.<br>
- Select the Number 1 with the Joystick. The Number 1 wilt appear above the Answer Line.<br>
- Now press the red Controller button to record your answer, 15.<br>
<br>
Some division problems will have a Remainder. To show the Remainder, move the Answer Line
two digits to the right of the Quotient. Select the Remainder number with the Joystick.
Now record your entire answer by pressing the red Controller button.<br>
<br>
Musical tunes announce whether your answer is right or wrong.<br>
<br>
- Correct answers receive a &quot;BEEP&quot; then a melodic tune. The Computer Teacher
automatically presents the next problem.<br>
- Wrong answers receive a &quot;BEEP&quot; and a melodic tune. But the wrong answer
disappears as the right answer flashes on the Blackboard Screen. The Computer Teacher
automatically presents the next problem.<br>
- The game is completed after 10 problems. At the conclusion of the last problem, the
total number of problems, 10, and the number correct answers flashes on the Blackboard
Screen.<br>
<br>
GAME I - Addition<br>
Select the top number you want to work with, then start<br>
adding.<br>
<br>
GAME 2 - Subtraction<br>
Select the top number you want to work with, then start<br>
subtracting.<br>
<br>
GAME 3 - Multiplication<br>
Select the top number you want to work with, then start<br>
multiplying.<br>
<br>
GAME 4 - Division<br>
Select the top number you want to work with, then start<br>
dividing.<br>
<br>
Follow the same rules and procedures to tackle Random Problems as you did to solve Table
Problems. Random Problems feature addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The
only difference between these games and Games 1 through 4 is the absence of a top number
selection. You have no control over the numbers in these problems. For example, after you
select a subtraction game, the game presents subtraction problems at random. You begin
your answer immediately.<br>
<br>
GAME 5 - Addition<br>
The game automatically presents addition problems at<br>
random.<br>
<br>
GAME 6 - Subtraction<br>
Get ready for surprise subtraction problems.<br>
<br>
GAME 7 - Multiplication<br>
Practice your times tables with this game of multiplication.<br>
<br>
GAME 8 - Division<br>
Division problems are selected at random for you to solve.</font></p>
