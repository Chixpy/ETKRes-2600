SPACECHASE
You left Planet Earth just moments ago for routine moon-based 
primary-satellite scout duty.  You are commanding a squadron consisting of
three heavily armed Mark 16 Starcruisers.  Suddenly you are attacked by alien
enemy raiders energizing from the ether...obviously molecularly energized
from a distant galaxy.  They fire neutron missiles which will destroy your
Starcruiser upon impact.

Your mission is to destroy the alien enemy ships until reinforcements can
arrive from Planet Earth.  These arrive at the approximate rate of one
Starcruiser every 10,000 points.  The enemy's arsenal also consists of
Lazer-Directed Heat-Seeking Proton Missiles which are fired sparingly.

WARNING  As the battle progresses, the enemy grows desperate and fires the
Lazer-Directed Heat-Seeking Proton Missiles more frequently.

THE SET-UP

Spacechase(TM) is played with one or two players using the Joystick Controller.
Be sure the power is off whenever you insert or remove Spacechase(TM) from your
video game system.

THE DIFFICULTY SWITCH

Set the Difficulty Switch on the "B" (down) position to start.  Your missiles
have a greater velocity in this position, making it easier to hit the enemy.

To provide a handicap advantage for a less experienced player in a two player
game, you may vary the positions of the Difficulty Switch.  Simply leave the
switch in position B for the inexperienced player, and position A for the
more experienced player.

THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLER

ONE PLAYER GAMES.  Hold your Joystick Controller so that the red "FIRE" button
is in the upper lefthand corner.  Use this button to launch your missiles.
Using your Joystick Controller, move your Starcruiser over the mountain ranges
and craters on the face of the moon.  You can move in any of eight different
directions as illustrated above.  NOTE: Vertical movement (up and down) is
limited to the bottom one-third of the screen.

TWO PLAYER GAMES:  The play for Two Player games is the same as that described
for One Player games.  The only difference is that players take turns in
commanding the Starcruisers.  Each player's turn will continue until he loses
one Starcruiser from alien fire.

SCORING

Minimum Heat-Seeking Missiles:

Each time you destroy a Level One alien ship, you score 125 points.  A Level
Two alien ship scores 200 points.  A Level Three alien ship scores 275 points.
Each time you hit an alien missile you score an additional 50 points.

When your score reaches 10,000 points, the game automatically switches to
Level Two.  At 40,000 points, the game automatically switches to Level Three.
However, by utilizing the Game Select Switch as described in the Game Menu,
you can begin to score directly on Level Two or Level Three

Although you can score more points at Levels Two and Three, it is more
difficult to do because the alien ships are smaller and their missiles are
faster.

Maximum Heat-Seeking Missiles:

If you are playing a game that include Maximum Heat-Seeking Missiles, the
scoring is as follows: Level One: for each alien ship destroyed - 175 points.
Level Two: for each alien ship destroyed - 250 points.  Level Three: for each
alien ship destroyed - 325 points.  In addition, for each Heat Seeking Missile
you destroy, you receive an additional 100 points.
