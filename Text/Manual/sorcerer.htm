<p>Many centuries ago, the Earth was ruled by Sorcerers and Wizards. They possessed
mystical powers capable of both good and evil. The most respected influences in the land
were from the good Sorcerers. This fact continually disturbed the evil Wizards, and they
eventually decided to use their power to conquer the countryside and enslave its people.
They devised a plan to systematically eliminate the good Sorcerers by sending wave after
wave of diabolical creatures to ravage the world.<br>
<br>
As the bravest of the good Sorcerers you have been asked to destroy these forces and save
the planet. As a reward for your bravery: whenever you overcome or destroy a creature, you
will receive a treasure.<br>
<br>
Knowing your bravery the Wizards have done everything within their power to keep you from
succeeding. They don't believe you will survive their first three waves of evil, but just
in case you do they have several surprises waiting, Only you can discover through bravery
and talent how evil they can become.<br>
To give you more power over the Forces of Evil the good Sorcerers have provided a magical
Flying Platform. When you start on your journey you should first catch this elusive
platform. You can continue without it, but only the foolish would dare to do so. Once on
the Flying Platform you can go anywhere on the screen to avoid or destroy the enemy. The
good Sorcerers have also given you four lives to use against the Forces of Evil.<br>
<br>
<strong>GETTING STARTED</strong><br>
1. Plug in Joystick or Ball Controller.<br>
<br>
2. Turn power OFF, insert game cartridge.<br>
<br>
3. Turn power ON.<br>
<br>
4. DIFFICULTY SWITCHES are not used with SORCERER.&nbsp; The game automatically becomes
more difficult as your score increases,<br>
<br>
5. JOYSTICK CONTROLLERS move the Sorcerer left or right on the screen. In the first
screen, moving the joystick north will make the Sorcerer jump to catch the Flying
Platform. After getting on the Flying Platform the joystick moves the Sorcerer in all
directions. When the Flying Platform gets close to the ground, it dissolves and the
Sorcerer may run left or right. Moving the joystick up will cause the Flying Platform to
reappear.<br>
The red fire button on the joystick fires in the direction you are facing. It is not
possible to move left off the screen. All additional screens are to the right.<br>
<br>
6. BALL CONTROLLERS work very well with SORCERER. Higher scores should be possible.<br>
<br>
7. GAME SELECT SWITCH will allow you to choose the level of difficulty and whether one or
two players will be playing.<br>
<br>
Practice Mode, One Player -- No scoring, unlimited lives.<br>
Level One, One Player -- Scoring for successfully shooting Forces of Evil. Additional
scores for picking up treasures.<br>
Level One, Two Players -- Play alternates starting with the left controller. Level Two,
One Player -- Forces of Evil move much faster.<br>
Level Two, Two Players<br>
<br>
8. BEGIN PLAY by pressing the game reset button or by pressing the red fire button on your
controller. After each loss of a life a small controller symbol will appear at the top of
the screen. Pressing the red fire button on your controller will restart the game.<br>
<br>
9. SCORING is done by hitting the Forces of Evil with an energy charge and picking up
treasures. Each time you hit a force of evil with your energy charge you get 30 POINTS.
When they disappear a treasure will materialize. Touching the treasure gives you 80
POINTS. Successfully moving through the lightning storm will cause a treasure to come out
of the sky. Don't forget to pick up each treasure since once you have moved to the next
screen you can't go back. <br>
<br>
10. LIVES remaining, in addition to the life you are currently using, are displayed at the
top of the screen. When the game begins you have four lives. Three remaining lives are
displayed. When no remaining lives are showing you have only the one life you are using.<br>
<br>
11. DIFFICULTY is determined automatically by your score after you select the Practice,
First Level or Second Level of difficulty. In the Practice Level you are able to get into
every screen meeting all of the Forces of Evil. In the First Level of difficulty you must
achieve higher scores before you gain access to more Forces of Evil and Treasures. When
the game begins you have three different screens in which to move. These screens repeat
until you reach 1000 points at which time another screen containing more Forces of Evil
opens. With each additional 1000 points earned another screen with additional Forces of
Evil opens. After 4000 points are earned surprising things start to happen to one of the
sets of Forces of Evil. With each additional 1000 points the changes continue making the
game harder and harder. Only truly great game players will discover what finally happens
to the Forces of Evil before you reach the ultimate score of 9999.<br>
The Second Level of difficulty has the same features as the First Level but all of the
Forces of Evil are much more evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big><strong>GAME FEATURES</strong></big><br>
<br>
SORCERER by Mythicon offers tremendous variety in the types of enemies you, as the
Sorcerer, will encounter. As you get better you will open screen after screen of
additional Forces of Evil. As you get into the higher score levels the Forces of Evil
continue their changes making it even harder to keep moving on. By automatically making
the game more interesting as your skills improve you should get much more enjoyment from
SORCERER than many of the games available today.<br>
<br>
The music in SORCERER was created especially for Mythicon. You will notice that as you
destroy an enemy the music changes. As soon as you enter another screen containing Forces
of Evil the music will warn you to be cautious.<br>
