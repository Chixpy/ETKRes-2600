        Space Jockey is a single player, full color, action game
designed to be played on the ATARI(r) Video Computer System(tm) or
the Sears Tele-Game(tm).

        You are a Space Jockey at the controls of a highly maneuverable
Attack Saucer, which appears on the left side of the screen.  A variety
of enemy weapons and obstacles appear on the right and move toward your
space ship.  These include tanks, jet planes, prop planes and
helicopters, which all fire at you.  Additionally, there are balloons,
houses and trees that do not fire but are obstacles capable of
destroying your Attack Saucer upon impact.

        Your objective is to shoot down as many of the enemy objects
as possible, scoring as many points as possible, while at the same
time avoiding enemy fire.

        Initially you have a fleet of three space ships available to
you.  For each 1,000 points you can score, an additional ship will be
available to you.

   the manufacturer's instructions.

   SELECT switch will cycle the unit through the 16 possible game
