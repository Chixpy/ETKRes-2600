<strong>Name This Game</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">This is a one or two player, full color game designed
to be played on the Atari(R) Video Computer System&#153; or the Sears Video Arcade®.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">You have discovered a long-sought-after buried
treasure, and just when you thought your ou have discovered a long-sought-after troubles
were over, things get really tough! There's a persistent shark who thinks that the
treasure belongs to him, and he is after you! As if that were not enough to contend with,
there's a big old octopus sitting right above your trove who keeps reaching down to check
things out.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">There you are, shooting at the shark, fighting off
the octopus tentacles, and you realize your oxygen supply is running low. Your partner, in
the boat, keeps dropping you a line, and you better run over and fill up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">It is not going to be easy to hold on to your
treasure now that you've found it, but we're sure you are not going to give it up without
a fight.</font></p>

<strong>Playing Hints:</strong></font>

<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">During the early waves, concentrate on getting as many
    points as possible. Continuously fire at the descending tentacles while waiting for the
    shark to swing to deeper levels. (You get more points if he is deeper; but don't wait too
    long, or you're shark bait!) Keep an eye on your air supply (red bar at bottom of screen);
    but at early levels, you can last longer on a recharge.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">Later waves (3-4) require more concentration on
    imminent dangers; for instance, the sharks are hungrier, and therefore, faster--especially
    approaching the diver's depth. Tentacles also descend more quickly, and air supply is
    depleted faster. Try to combine shooting of the tentacles and the shark in the same area
    of the water. This will save you time in moving about the sea floor.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">The advanced waves are rather frantic and involve
    concentration on one thing--saving your treasure. For those of you who can't walk and chew
    gum at the same time, these will prove to be very challenging levels. The most enduring
    strategy is to attempt shooting at the shark and tentacles at the same time, all the while
    trying to move with the boat to stay near your air supply line.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Courier New">Hang on to your snorkel; more trouble is on the way!</font></li>
</ul>
