The County Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Objective:	Run the highway gauntlet and bow up Porky's bar.  Sound
		easy? Try it...you'll see.

Controls: 	Pee Wee moves to the right or left only as long as you 
		hold the joystick in that direction.  In the up and down
		directions, Pee Wee will attempt to move all the way into
		the next band unless you reverse the direction to stop it.

Scoring: 	Points are accumulated by successfully dodging the 
		obstacles and distractions in the highway bands.
	
		Motor Boat, 1 point; The Police, 100 points; Porky's 
		Girls, 200 points; Attack Pigs, 400 points; Porky's
		Bouncers, 800 points; Pig Mobil, 1600 points; Last
		Band, 3200 points.

Warning: 	The action's hot and heavy.  If Pee Wee gets hit .. it's
		in the drink.

The Swamp
~~~~~~~~~

Objective:	Get out of the swamp!  And that's easier said than done.
		To escape you must pole vault over the swamp, collect
		and place four bricks to form an escape ladder.

Controls:	Vaulting is accomplished by running toward the vault-
		ing pole and pressing the joystick button while Pee
		Wee is within the allowable range.  Watch your thumb
		pressure if you want to make it to the other side.  To
		place bricks, move against the ladder and press the
		button of the joystick.

Scoring:	Brick placed		+100 points
		Exiting scene		+100 points
		Each polevault jump 	-25 points
		Falling into swamp	-100 points
		Caught by Porky 	-random number of points

Warning:	If you find yourself back in the swamp, you won't have to
		rebuild the ladder.  But .. you will have to look out
		for Porky and is he ever mad.

The Shower
~~~~~~~~~~

Objective:	To keep your mind off of Wendy and on the task at hand -
		pushing the brightly colored object at the top of the
		screen into the pit without falling in or being caught
		by Ms. Balbricker.  Each object pushed into the pit
		stops and/or slows a band on the highway screen.

Controls:	To maneuver around the gymnasium, move Pee Wee right/left
		and up/down the ladders with the joystick.  When you need
		to jump, press the button.

Scoring:	Pushing object into pit		+100 points
		Loitering in locker room	-10 each 10 seconds
		Falling into the pit		-200 points
		Caught by Balbricker		-200 points

Warning:	Once you climb out of the shower scene, you will re-enter
		the county line scene and one of the bands will be
		stopped.  Each trip through the shower stops an additional
		band, slowing the action until you are successful in 
		reaching Porky's bar.  Don't dawdle too long; it's costing
		you points.

----

Porky's Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~

Objective: 	Blow the blasted bar away!  To do so you must follow the
		correct path to the top of the scaffolding, planting
		dynamite charges as you go.  If you reach the top, a
		detonator will appear, and it's bye-bye Porky's.

Controls:	To climb the scaffolding, position Pee Wee next to the
		post and push the joystick up.  Only one path will work
		and it must be approached from the bottom.  If you're on
		the right path, the arrow on the left of the screen will
		turn green.  If you're wrong, the arrow will turn red
		and you must return to the bottom level and start again.

Scoring:	Exiting scaffolding	variable score based on difficulty
					+100 - 3200 points
		Caught by Porky		-200 points

The End
~~~~~~~

How sweet it is.  But, before you start bragging to your friends, check 
your score.  You can blow up the bar and end up with a high or low 
score.  An expert can have a score as high as 8000.  So try again.  The 
action never stops at Porky's!
