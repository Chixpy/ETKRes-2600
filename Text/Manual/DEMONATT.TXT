*** Demon Attack (1 or 2 players) ***

Imagic
Demon Attack
Game Program Instructions

Marooned on the ice planet Krybor, you watch legions of eerie creatures
scream overhead.  They hover ominously.  They give you no quarter.  Attack and
destroy them, or be destroyed!  Armed with your Laser Cannon, you confront the
ultimate challenge:  SURVIVE!

OBJECTIVE

Destroy demons and accumulate points before you and your LASER CANNON meet
with oblivion.  Keep RESERVE BUNKERS intact and increase their number by
avoiding your foes' fire.  When the last bunker disintegrates, the next enemy
hit will pulverize you!

GAME PLAY

Your LASER CANNON has unlimited firing power.

Dodge left or right to avoid enemy fire while pursuing aliens.

Accumulate RESERVE BUNKERS (bottom left of screen).  You begin with 3.

Each attack wave you survive completely unscathed earns you an additional
bunker, to a maximum of 6.

Every hit you absorb destroys an additional bunker.

When all bunkers disappear, another alien barrage will vaporize you.

HAND CONTROLS

Your JOYSTICK CONTROLLER allows you to manuver.  Position controller so that
the RED FIRING BUTTON rests in the upper left-hand corner.  To move the LASER
CANNON LEFT, push joystick LEFT; for RIGHT mobility, lean joystick RIGHT.

To FIRE: press red button.

1-player versions: use LEFT hand controller.

CONSOLE UNIT

Flip GAME SELECT LEVER to choose a Demon Attack game.

GAME NUMBER appears at top center of screen.

Hit GAME RESET LEVER to begin action.  Game begins again whenever Reset lever
is tapped.

FIRE BUTTON on LEFT hand controller will RESET game when previous game ends.

RIGHT AND LEFT DIFFICULTY LEVERS determine how aggresively the demons attack:

A=Aggressive Action
B=Basic Bombardment

1 PLAYER: set only LEFT DIFFICULTY LEVER
2 PLAYERS: set both LEFT AND RIGHT DIFFICULTY LEVERS (See TIPS)

1-PLAYER GAMES

GAMES 1,3,5 AND 7 pit you against progressively more difficult waves of alien
adversaries.  Pick up the pace: the higher the game number, the greater the
challenge!

GAMES 3 AND 7 feature special TRACER SHOTS.  Your Laser Cannon powers fire all
over the screen.

2-PLAYER GAMES

GAMES 2,4,6 AND 8 match your wits against more than waves of winged warriors!

EACH PLAYER
	takes on similar waves of demons

	manuvers a separate Laser Cannon
	  LEFT joystick: RED
	  RIGHT joystick: GOLD

	has own reserve bunkers

	registers an independent score which shows when your Laser Cannon
	appears on the screen

  Play alternates between players at the end of each wave.

  If both players survive the assault, they proceed to the next wave.

  If ONE PLAYER LOSES ALL RESERVE BUNKERS and gets vaporized, the other
  continues on to succeeding waves.

  Both players' scores show at game's end, keyed to Laser Cannon color.

  GAMES 4 AND 8 feature special TRACER SHOTS.

SPECIAL CO-OP VERSIONS

  GAMES 9 AND 10 allow 2 players to take turns against the same wave of attack.

  LASER CANNON CONTROL ALTERNATES EVERY FOUR SECONDS.  Keep track of your 
  color!

  Independent scores appear on screen.

  You share reserve bunkers; when they're gone, another blast ends the game.

  GAME 9: uses standard weaponry

  GAME 10: uses tracer shots

  If you are hit in games 9 or 10, your "PARTNER" scores an additional 500
  POINTS.
