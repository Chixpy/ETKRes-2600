Game Description<br>
-------------------------<br>
The enemy commands a contingent of space creatures to break down our base<br>
which keeps a secret illustration of the star Venus. We have six anti-<br>
spacecreature tanks with unlimited missiles to attack the enemy's armed corp.<br>
One of the six is active, and the others are reserve. Our mission is to<br>
shoot them, but we should dodge their missiles quickly. The speed of the <br>
enemy creatures on the screen is faster than that on the previous, and the<br>
scores we get by shooting one creature is increased by 10 points from the<br>
previous screen's points.<br>
<br>
