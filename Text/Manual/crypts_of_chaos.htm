<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
<strong>CRYPTS OF CHAOS(tm) </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>TO BEGIN:</strong> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Set up your video computer system and left joystick
controller as indicated in your manufacturer's owner manual. Turn the power switch OFF and
insert the Crypts of Chaos game cartridge. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Turn the power ON. Use the Game Select lever and
Difficulty Switches to choose a play level. Press the Game Reset lever and prepare to
descend into the mysterious Crypts of Chaos! </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
<strong>THE OBJECTIVE: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Your objective is to descend as far into the Crypts
as possible, stealing every treasure and killing every Monster you can get your hands on.
You must try to keep your Hit Count high enough to escape the Crypts alive. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The Crypts of Chaos are a series of complicated
mazes. In order not to get discouraged, please read the instruction manual carefully and
draw maps of the Crypts as you travel them. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
<strong>SCREEN DISPLAY: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Upon entering the Crypts, you will see two small
squares, or cursors, and a row of symbols at the bottom of the playing screen. The top
cursor represents &quot;You&quot; and your &quot;Weapon.&quot; The lower cursor represents
which &quot;Action&quot; is selected. The row of symbols represent your &quot;Action
Options.&quot; Your Hit Count is shown in the upper left corner of the screen. Hits
represent your life forces and when the count reaches 00, you've become the latest victim
of the Crypts. Your current Score is displayed in the upper right corner. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
<strong>JOYSTICK CONTROL: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Push the joystick forward to walk down the Corridors.
Passing wall segments and a stepping sound indicate that you are moving forward. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">When you reach an Intersection, tilt the joystick all
the way to the left or right to turn. You will hear a &quot;beep&quot; to let you know
that you have turned a corner and are facing 90 degrees to the left or right. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">When a Monster appears on the screen, you will NOT be
able to move forward; and you must take action before continuing on. Pull the joystick
toward you and to the left or right to select an Action Option. When the cursor is over
the action you want, push the joystick straight forward to &quot;lock&quot; the option in.
If needed, tilt the joystick to the left or right to aim your weapon. Press the joystick
button to activate the Option. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
<strong>SCORING: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Points are added to your score for slaying Monsters
and stealing their Treasures. The tougher the Monster is, the more points it is worth and
the more Treasure is in its lair. Bonus points are awarded for leaving the Crypts alive
(except in the easy practice game). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Points are deducted from the Hit Count when Monsters
get too close to you. The game ends when all your Hit Counts are used up or when you leave
the Crypt. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">SCORE RATINGS: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">0 - 1000 = Serf 2000 - 3000 = Courtier over 4000 =
Noble<br>
1000 - 2000 = Page 3000 - 4000 = Knight<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
<strong>MONSTERS: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">There are eight different Monsters wandering around
through the Crypts. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Some of these Monsters are harder to slay than
others, and will require several attacks from your weapon. The monster's color indicates
its strength. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The charts below list the monsters and their colors
from weakest to strongest. A Green Troll will be easy to snuff, while a Gold Dragon will
put up quite a fight. </font></p>

<strong>THE CRYPT: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The Crypts of Chaos are made up of many Floors. Each
Floor is a separate maze. there are four maze formats which repeat as you descend into the
Crypt. (Floors 1, 5, 9, 13... are maze format A. Floors 2, 6, 10, 14... are maze B. Floors
3, 7, 11, 15... are maze C; and Floors 4, 8, 12, 16... are maze D.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Each maze consists of several Corridors, 4-way
Intersections, and Dead Ends. There are eight Monster Lairs on each Floor and one UP and
one DOWN Stairway. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">It is up to you to keep track of what Floor you are
on and what portion of the maze you are in. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>CRYPT FLOORS: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Each Floor of the Crypts of Chaos is guarded by
Monsters. Trolls guard the top Floor; Trolls and Frogs guard the second Floor; Trolls,
Frogs and Snakes guard the third Floor and so on; until Floor eight when all of the
Monsters are present. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">All of the Monsters are present below Floor eight.
the further you descend, the more charges it takes to slay the monsters and the more
points they can take from your Hit Count. Of course, the Monsters are also worth more
points when slain. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">To leave the Crypt alive, you must stop descending
when you are almost out of Hits and head for the exit on the top floor. To our knowledge,
no one has ever reached the bottom of the Crypts. Consider yourself a Noble if you can
descend to Floor 18 and still get out alive. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">NOTE: Monsters and Treasures are replenished each
time you leave a Floor. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>CORRIDORS: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Most of the Crypt is made up of Corridors (see screen
#1). You must walk down the Corridors until you come to one of the following situations: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">#1 CORRIDOR </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(screenshot walking down a corridor) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">#2 WARNING - You are approaching a Dead End,
T-Intersection or Lair </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(screenshot showing the end of the hall in black) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">DEAD ENDS/INTERSECTIONS: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">When you approach any Intersection, you will
automatically slow down. If you are approaching a Dead End or a T-Intersection, the same
two visual warning screens will appear (see screens #2 and #3) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">#3 WARNING - You are approaching a Dead End or a
T-Intersection </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(screenshot showing dead end or intersection) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">#4 T-Intersection </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(screenshot showing intersection, walls are red) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The actual T-Intersections and Dead Ends are bright
red. If the outside wall segments are missing, you know that you can turn right or left
(see screen #4). If the wall segments are visible, it is a Dead End and you must use a
U-TURN to go back 9see screen #5). (It is possible to turn from a T-Intersection into
another T-Intersection or a Dead End without any visual warning screens.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">#5 DEAD END </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(screenshot showing a dead end) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">#6 4-WAY INTERSECTION </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(screenshot showing four way intersection in blue) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">A 4-Way Intersection appears with no visual warning
screens. When you reach one, the Corridor walls turn bright blue and the outside wall
segments disappear (see screen #6). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>LAIRS: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">There are eight Lairs on each Crypt Floor. You know
you are approaching one by the following visual warning screens. You first come across the
same small opening at the end of the Corridor that warns of a Dead End or a T-Intersection
(see screen #2). Then you walk into a larger opening (see screen #7) before you finally
arrive at a Lair (see screen #8). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Only the Lairs are purple in color. All Lairs are
Dead Ends and must be exited with U-TURNS. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">#7 WARNING - You are approaching a Lair </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(screenshot showing large opening at end of corridor)
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">#8 MONSTER'S LAIR </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(screenshot showing purple dead end) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>STAIRCASES: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Staircases are dark red and lead either UP or DOWN to
a different Floor of the Crypt (see screens #9 and #10). An UP Staircase is always at an
Intersection. DOWN Staircases may be found anywhere in the maze. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The UP Staircases are always adjacent to the entrance
of the Floor. This aids in swift upward traveling. The UP Staircase on the top Floor is
the only way out of the Crypt. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">#9 UP STAIRCASE </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(screenshot of up staircase) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">#10 DOWN STAIRCASE </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(screenshot of down staircase) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">When you have found a Monster's Lair, you will
naturally want to steal the Treasure in it. First you must destroy the guarding Monster
and then select the TREASURE SACK option. Press the fire button. The length of the gold
bar that rises from your cursor shows how much Treasure you have picked up. Your score
will reflect that amount. There is only one Treasure in any Lair. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Select the SWORD option and press the joystick button
when you're ready to slice a Monster at short range. The Sword will never run out of
magical charges. Wizards CANNOT be harmed by the Sword. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Use the WAND for long-range firing. Although it has a
fairly large supply of charges, it will eventually run out, so aim carefully. The Wand has
no effect on Dragons. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The RING is your most powerful weapon, but it has
fewer charges than the Sword or Wand. Any time you use the Ring, it will take life forces
from the Monster and add them to your Hit Count, regardless of whether or not the Monster
is slain. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Intelligent Monsters can be convinced to go away and
leave you alone when shown the PEACE symbol. The intelligent Monsters are Trolls, Eyes,
Wizards and Dragons. The Peace symbol will never run out of power; however, the Peace
symbol is not effective on any Monster in a Lair. You will not receive any points for
getting rid of a Monster with a Peace symbol. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">To leave a Lair or a Dead-End, or to turn around in a
Corridor, use the U-TURN. If there is a Monster present on the screen, you will not be
able to turn around. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
<strong>WEAPON RECHARGING: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">If you take the Treasures from all eight Lairs on a
Crypt Floor and then go DOWN the stairs to the next Floor, you will receive ten extra
Charges for your Wand and two extra Charges for your Ring. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
<strong>PLAY LEVELS/DIFFICULTY SWITCHES: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">LEVEL 1: NORMAL GAME PLAY = You begin on Floor 5 with
90 Hits, 127 Wand Charges and 31 Ring Charges. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">LEVEL 2: ADVANCED GAME PLAY = You begin on Floor 9
with 90 Hits, 63 Wand Charges and 15 Ring Charges. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">LEVEL 3: EXPERT GAME PLAY = You begin on Floor 13

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">LEVEL 4: EASY PRACTICE GAME = You begin on Floor 1
with 90 Hits, 255 Wand Charges and 63 Ring Charges. You do not receive any bonus points
for leaving the Crypt alive on this level of play. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">BOTH DIFFICULTY SWITCHES ON B: Wandering Monsters
appear at the standard rate. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">ONE DIFFICULTY SWITCH ON A, ONE SWITCH ON B:
Wandering Monsters appear twice as often. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">BOTH DIFFICULTY SWITCHES ON A: Wandering Monsters
appear four times as often. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
<strong>HINTS FROM JOHN W. S. MARVIN... </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Remember to take the Treasure from all eight Lairs on
each level to get bonus charges for your Ring and Wand. Avoid combat with wandering
Monsters that might waste Hits and weapon Charges. Don't waste time in the Corridors, but
seek out the Lairs and take all the treasure you can. Keep the joystick pressed forward if
you want to use the Sword, for it will close the distance between you and the Monster.
When you're running low on Hits and Charges, try to make it out of the Crypts by ascending
the Up Staircases to the surface. Be brave, be quick and trust in your luck. Good Hunting!
