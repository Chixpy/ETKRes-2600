<p>System</p>
</b>

<p>Joystick</p>

<p>Boing! Is a 1-player game. Plug joystick into left joystick port. The joystick moves
BUBBLE in four directions: up, down, right and left. The BUBBLE cannot move diagonally. By
holding the joystick in one direction the BUBBLE will jump repeatedly in that direction.
When the BUBBLE reaches the edge of the playfield, it can go no further. You can move one
step at a time by tapping the joystick.</p>

<p>Controls</p>

<p>The Game Select Switch allows the player to choose one of the first 3 levels (levels 4
through 6 must be earned). Push this switch down and watch the level change at the bottom
of the screen. Once you have selected the level you wish to play, press the trigger on the
joystick or Game Reset. The Game Select feature may be used at anytime, during play or
demo. The Game Reset Switch will restart the game. It will start at the level previously
selected. It can be used at anytime.</p>

<p>Demo</p>

<p>The game has a self-playing demo which shows the general play action of all 6 levels.
The demo automatically comes on and will begin again immediately after the player has lost
the last BUBBLE.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>

<p>The Game</p>
</b>

<p>You bounce the BUBBLE around a playfield of 36 STEPS (6 rows of 6). The BUBBLE must
land on each step and turn it &quot;on&quot;, sometimes in a particular order. The BUBBLE
EATER or the PIN will pop the BUBBLE if either comes in contact with it. The BUBBLE EATER
chases the BUBBLE, while the PIN descends the steps from the top row down. The PIN will
pop the BUBBLE or the BUBBLE EATER if they are in its path.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to jump the BUBBLE around and turn each step on. When you
first begin the game a short tune will play before you can start. Int the first 3 levels,
jumping on a step will turn it on and leave it on; but in the last 3 levels, each time you
jump on a stepit will reverse: if it's &quot;off&quot;, it turns &quot;on&quot; - if it's
&quot;on&quot; it turns &quot;off! On some levels you must turn on a particular row or
rows of steps before you can turn on steps in any other row (see LEVELS).</p>

<p>The BUBBLE EATER always start out in the lower right corner, waits a couple of seconds
and the tries to catch you (the BUBBLE). If he lands on you or you lands on him, you lose
a BUBBLE. The PIN starts out at the top, randomly choosing one of the 6 columns. Avoid the
PIN as it is a fatal to the BUBBLE! You can tomporarily zap the BUBBLE EATER by luring him
under the oncoming PIN. The BUBBLE EATER disintegrates and starts glowing. After a few
seconds the BUBBLE EATER reappears and continues the chase. Make good use of this time!
The glowing time (when you are safe) decreases as the waves advance (see LEVELS). You can
turn on steps while the BUBBLE EATER is out of commission. When the BUBBLE EATER is
stunned and glowing, the BUBBLE can jump on him without popping.</p>

<p>BUBBLES</p>

<p>You start the game with 5 BUBBLES. 3 of which are displayed at the bottom of the
screen. Every time you are popped you lose a BUBBLE. For every 10,000 points you score,
you are awarded a bonus BUBBLE. If you are popped while on the lower right hand step, you
will automatically be moved one step to the left to avoid being popped repeatedly.</p>

<p>Upon losing the last BUBBLE, the game will end, thus activating the demo mode. Your
score will remain at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>LEVELS</p>

<p>There are 6 game levels, numbered 1 through 6. In each level of plaqy there are 5
waves. With each wave, the BUBBLE EATER becomes faster and more intelligent than in the
last wave. The glowing time of the BUBBLE EATER, when he is popped, will decrease with
each higher wave. If you complete all 5 waves you will advance to the next level. The new
level number will be displayed briefly at the bottom of the screen and a short tune will
be played. The player has the option to select levels on through 3 with the Game Select
Switch. Levels 4 through 6 must be earned by winning the previous level.</p>

<p>Level 1: If the BUBBLE jumps on any step is off, the step turns on. Landing on a step
more than once has no effect.</p>

<p>Level 2: Jumping on a step turns it on. However you must turn on all the steps of the
indicated row before going to the next row. The indicated row is clearly marked by the
white edges. You start with the bottom row and turn on all 6 steps across. Once the bottom
row is complete, you must then turn on the 6 steps of the next row up. This continues all
the way up to the top row.</p>

<p>Level 3: Jumping on a step turns it on. However you must turn on the steps of all three
even rows before you can turn on the steps of the 3 odd rows. The rows to turn on are
clearly indicated with white.</p>

<p>Level 4: Jumping on a step always reverses its current condition. For example: land on
a turned off step, it turns on. Land on a turned on step, it turns off.</p>

<p>Level 5: Jumping on a step always reverses its current condition. Howerver, like level
2, you must turn on the six steps of the indicated row before going up to the next row.</p>

<p>Level 6: Jumping on a step always reverses its current condition. However, like level
3, you must turn on the steps of all the 3 even rows, indicated with white, before you can
turn on the steps of the 3 odd rows.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>

<p>Scoring</p>
</b>

<p>There are 4 ways to score points:</p>

<p>You score points every time you turn on a step. In level 4, 5 and 6, where a step turns
on and off, you score points every time you turn it on again.</p>

<p>You receive 300 points the first time the BUBBLE EATER is popped in each wave.</p>

<p>Hundreds of points are awarded for each wave you finish. The amount of points depends
on the wave and level number you have completed. In addition, when you complete a level
you also score additional points.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>

<p>Strategy/Tips</p>
</b>

<p>The BUBBLE will move quickly around the screen, so don't be afraid to &quot;go for
it&quot;. One important feature to realize is that you may jump through the BUBBLE EATER
or the PIN. If the BUBBLE is in the air the same time that the attacker is, the BUBBLE
will remain intact.</p>

<p>Watch out when you are on the top row, because the PIN starts on this row. The PIN
starts randomly at any of the top 6 steps and proceed down. If you are popped on the top
row, it is wise to jump off to the next row down immediatly with your next BUBBLE to avoid
being popped again. The PIN will reappear at the top row if anyone is popped. Therefore,
if the BUBBLE EATER is popped, and you are near the top row, watch for the PIN to suddenly
appear.</p>

<p>The PIN will pop either the BUBBLE or the BUBBLE EATER if they are in its path.
Therefore, you may lure the BUBBLE EATER in front of an oncoming PIN and purposefully pop
it. The BUBBLE EATER is chasing the BUBBLE, so you move the BUBBLE and watch the decending
PIN, timing your actions so that the BUBBLE EATER becomes disabled. You receive 300 points
the first time the BUBBLE EATER is popped in each wave (see SCORING).</p>

<p>Be careful, the glowing BUBBLE EATER comes back to life without warning.</p>

<p>You can jump on the BUBBLE EATER or the PIN if one of them is on the last step needed
to complete a wave, without losing a BUBBLE.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a level the PIN will be frozen at the top of the steps, above the
column it will descend.</p>
