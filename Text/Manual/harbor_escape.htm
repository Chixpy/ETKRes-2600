<br>
You have just dropped off a group of commandos on the inland coast of Russia for a search
and destroy mission. As commander of one of our finest nuclear submarines, your main
objective is to safely escape the many harbors you secretly must pass to report the
success of the drop.<br>
<br>
Thinking ahead, you also dropped off tanks of air on your incoming trip so that no
surfacing will be necessary. Unfortunately, an alert Russian Harbor Commander has picked
you up on sonar and has dispatched roving nuclear mines and submarines as well as closed
up all channel locks.<br>
<br>
In addition to the now alerted Russian Navy, you must deal with navigating your sub
through narrowing channels and reefs that are barely wide enough for your sub.
Furthermore, less and less air tanks are where you dropped them, leaving your air supply
critical.<br>
<br>
