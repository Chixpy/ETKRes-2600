               <strong>RealSports TENNIS</strong>

Note: Always turn the console POWER switch OFF when insert-
ing or removing an ATARI Game Program+ cartridge. This will
protect the electronic components and prolong the life of
your ATARI 2600+ Video Computer System+ game.

GAME PLAY

You win the RealSports+
TENNIS match by win-
ning the most games in
two out of three sets.
Points are scored by hit-
ting a ball over the net
that your opponent
can't return.

After each game, the
receiver becomes the
server. Players switch
sides after the first
game and then after
every other game, ac-
cording to the rules of
tennis.

RealSports TENNIS can
be played by one or
two players at slow or
fast speed. In addition,
each player can play
with automatic or man-
ual racket control (see
DIFFICULTY SWITCHES).


USING THE CONTROLLERS

Use your Joystick Con-
trollers with this ATARI
Game Program+ car-
tridge. Be sure the
cables are firmly
plugged into the jacks
at the back of your
console. For one-player
games, plug your con-
troller into the LEFT CON-
TROLLER jack. Hold the
controller with the red
button to your upper
left, toward the televi-
sion screen. See your
owner's manual for
further details.

STARTING THE GAME

Move your Joystick for-
ward until the start arrow
() appears on your
scoreboard, then press
the red controller but-
ton to start the game.
You can also persona-
lize your tennis score-
board by writing in your
player's name: Move
the Joystick forward
and back to select a
letter, space, period or
backspace from the
scrolling alphabet.
When the desired char-
acter appears, press
the red controller but-
ton. Then select the start
arrow to begin the
game (figure 1).

Note: If your name fills
in all eight character
spaces, simply press
the controller button to
start. then, get ready to
serve!


PLAYER CONTROL

Move your Joystick in
the direction you want
your player to go. Press
the red controller but-
ton to serve the ball. In
one-player games you
must also press the but-
ton to make the com-
puter player serve the
ball.

Note: In some games,
the red controller but-
ton is used to swing the
racket (see DIFFICULTY
SWITCHES).

There are three kinds of
shots in RealSports
TENNIS: a normal shot, a
hard hit, and a lob. A
normal shot is hit when
your player is standing
still or moving from side
to side; a hard hit when
your player is running
towards the net; and a
lob when your player is
running away from the
net.

You can angle your
shot by hitting the ball
with the tip of your
racket. The closer the
ball is to your player's
body, the straighter
your shot will be. In ad-
dition, the computer
automatically adjusts
the players to hit
backhand.


CONSOLE CONTROLS
-----------------

GAME SELECT/
GAME RESET

Press GAME SELECT to
choose a one- or two-
player game at fast or
slow speed. Your choice
is displayed on the
scoreboard (figure 2).

Press GAME RESET to
bring up the scrolling
alphabet. The letter A will
appear. The game will
begin after you have
entered a name or
selected the start arrow.

DIFFICULTY SWITCHES

Use your DIFFICULTY
switch to select auto-
matic or manual racket
control. In the A posi-
tion, you must press the
controller button to
swing your player's
racket; in the B position,
your player will automa-
tically hit a ball within
range.

In one-player games
the right DIFFICULTY
switch controls the com-
puter player's game
play. When the switch is
in the A position, the
computer plays more
skillfully than when it is
in the B position.

SCORING

Scoring is similar to real
tennis. Players compete
to win games, sets, and
finally, to win the match.

GAMES

For each game, points
are scored as follows:

First point    = 15
Second point   = 30
Third point    = 40
Fourth point   = Game

To win a game, a play-
er must have a two-
point lead. If both play-
ers score three points
(40 each), the score is
called DEUCE. The next
player to score a point
has the advantage (AD),
and must score another
point to win the game.
If the other player
scores a point, the
score is called DEUCE
again until one player
scores the necessary
two points.

SETS AND THE MATCH

The first player to win six
games with a two-game
lead wins the set. If the
score is six-to-six, an-
other game is added to
break the tie. The player
that wins two out of three
sets wins the match.

HELPFUL HINTS

* Try rushing the net
after a serve to hit the
ball before it bounces.
The other player will hit
from the baseline. Then
suddenly, hit the ball at
an angle - out of the
other player's reach.

* Play a one-player
slow game to practice
different shots against
the computer-pro. Then
try mixing your shots to
catch the computer off
guard.

* Try hitting a lob when
your opponent comes
to the net. This may
throw your opponent off
balance or give you
time to reposition your-
self on the court for a
new attack.

* If the other player
moves up to the net, hit
the ball to the baseline.
Your opponent will have
a hard time returning
the ball in time. Use the
same tactic by hitting
the ball to the sidelines.
