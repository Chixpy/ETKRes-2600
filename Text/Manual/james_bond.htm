<p><font face="Verdana">SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS<br>
<br>
1. Place the cartridge firmly into the cartridge slot.<br>
2. Since this is a one-player game, plug a joystick controller firmly into the LEFT
controller jack.<br>
3. Turn the ON/OFF switch to ON.<br>
4. Set the TV TYPE switch to COLOR (even if you're using a black and white TV).<br>
5. Press GAME SELECT to choose either the NOVICE (easy) or AGENT (expert) difficulty
levels.<br>
6. Press the FIRE button or GAME RESET to begin. Three of the five remaining crafts appear
in the lower left corner of the screen. Your score appears at the top.<br>
<br>
At any time during the game, you may press GAME SELECT to begin again, starting with the
difficulty options. Press GAME RESET, and you'll begin again with the first adventure.
&nbsp; Also, you may stop the action by setting the TV TYPE switch at B-W. To restart the
action, set the switch at COLOR.<br>
<br>
<strong>THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLER</strong><br>
The joystick controls Bond's specially designed multipurpose craft. The craft moves
forward with a right motion and slightly back with a left motion. An up or down motion
causes the craft to jump or dive. In either case, gravity or buoyancy returns the craft to
a water or land surface line.&nbsp; Each press of the FIRE button either lobs a bomb to
the bottom of the screen or fires a fixed angle shot to the top of the screen. These are
released alternately.<br>
<br>
<strong>YOUR ITINERARY, MR. BOND</strong><br>
In this game, you are Bond. James Bond, 007, the world's most famous secret agent.
Renowned for your cool and confidence (not to mention your biting wit), you've been
selected by the British Secret Service for three clandestine, utterly critical, and nearly
impossible missions.<br>
<br>
These will be accomplished at the controls of a specially designed multi-purpose craft
that boasts extraordinary capabilities. It has the properties of a car, a plane, and a
submarine. And it's equipped with the latest weaponry. We think you'll find it more than
adequate.<br>
In brief, Mr. Bond, this is what lies ahead. First stop, Las Vegas in Diamonds Are
Forever. No casinos, here. Rather, you've got to cross the desert in the dead of night. A
very romantic place, indeed, when you're not being shot at.<br>
<br>
In Moonraker, you'll recognize your old nemesis Hugo Drax and his poison satellites. From
your position on the lake, you must stop the satellites from ever reaching Earth.<br>
We know you like a change of scenery, Bond, so the next stop is Sardinia in The Spy Who
Loved Me. Stromberg's underwater laboratory is your destination in this one. We're
confident you'll know just what to do when you reach it.<br>
<br>
Oh, about the details, read on. We want you to be prepared for the assault.., frogmen,
missiles, submarines and the like. Not to worry. Good luck, Bond. And Bon Voyage!<br>
<br>
<big><strong>DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER</strong></big><br>
<br>
<strong>Mission: Land on Seraffino's Oil Rig arid Rescue Tiffany Case</strong><br>
There's lots of glitter in this adventure. But all that glitters is not gold.., it's
diamonds and Seraffino's got them! Black market jewelry scheme you're thinking? Wrong.
When attached to a communications satellite, the stolen rocks can harness solar energy,
create a laser blast, and destroy targets on the Earth's surface. Therefore, Bond, you
must get Seraffino. You'll find him on an oil rig off the Pacific coast. There, he
controls the diamond satellites' guidance system.&nbsp; By the way, Bond, Serration's
holding your.., uh... assistant, Tiffany Case. We believe she's desperately in need of
rescue.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Desert</strong><br>
First you must travel rugged desert terrain in the dead of night. The desert is filled
with treacherous, glowing craters that you must jump over--or else be swallowed into its
boiling radioactive material!<br>
<br>
<strong>The Satellites</strong><br>
As satellites pass overhead, they'll drop lasers that will destroy you on impact. Your
driving skills will be of the utmost importance in avoiding lasers since it's impossible
to destroy the satellites.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Helicopters</strong><br>
You'll notice, Bond, an occasional helicopter overhead. Sorry, old boy, it's not one of
ours. That search light is looking for you, and when it finds you, the chopper drops a
bomb. So don't be a sitting duck!<br>
<br>
<strong>The Diamonds</strong><br>
Giant diamonds hang in the night sky. Hit one with your fixed angle shot to light your way
(and to score points). And remember that only by the light of a diamond will you be able
to see Seraffino's oil rig once you reach the ocean.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Ocean</strong><br>
When you reach the ocean, continue to light the sky by hitting diamonds. Remember, you're
looking for the oil rig. Helicopters and satellites are still active, too. This time,
however, satellites drop lasers that cause a radioactive splash. Get caught in one, and
you've splashed your last.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Mechanical Frogmen</strong><br>
Seraffino's ultimate ocean weapons are his mechanical frogmen. They may look like marine
biologists, Bond, but actually are robots designed to create a radioactive splash upon
sensing the vibration of approaching crafts. So either clear the splash by jumping over
it--or get the frogman first. A most difficult maneuver, even for you, Bond!<br>
<br>
<strong>The Oil Rig</strong><br>
Seraffino's oil rig will be silhouetted against the sky when you hit a diamond. When it
appears, move your craft just to the left of the rig, straight up over the top of the
derrick, then down to land on the helipad. When this happens, you've stopped Seraffino and
saved Tiffany Case!<br>
<br>
<strong>Important:</strong><br>
If you've already sighted the oil rig but are unable to hit a diamond as you get closer,
dive under the oil rig quickly to avoid crashing and try again on the next one. Unless, of
course, you can land successfully in the dark! Hint: As you approach the oil rig in the
dark, your fixed angle shot will disappear right after firing. Take this as an immediate
warning!<br>
Completion of this mission brings you the next with your remaining crafts.<br>
<br>
<strong><big>MOONRAKER</big></strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Mission: Destroy Three Spinning Satellites</strong><br>
Billionaire industrialist Hugo Drax has concocted the ultimate scheme in international
espionage: the depopulation of the Earth in order to recolonize it with his super-race.
The destruction will occur through Drax's poison satellites that rotate through space. As
they spin through the night, you must attack them from your vehicle's position on, above,
or beneath the lake's surface. A deceptively difficult task.<br>
<br>
<strong>Space shuttles</strong><br>
Another of Drax's brilliant but dastardly inventions is the Moonraker fleet of space
shuttles. Launched from the bottom of the lake, they will destroy you on impact. And
remember this: when a space shuttle rises into orbit toward the top of the screen, it
turns into a poison bomb and falls back down again. If you're above the water surface when
it turns into a bomb, your craft is finished. How to handle a space shuttle? Blow it out
at its launch position, dodge it and submerge before it becomes a bomb, or shoot it down
in flight. And stay clear of the poison bomb when it hits the surface line and
explodes--unless you can shoot it down first!<br>
<br>
<strong>Submarines</strong><br>
Drax has sent a fleet of torpedo submarines to patrol the depths. The torpedoes are fired
from behind so avoid them or destroy them before they destroy you. Better yet, try to get
the subs before they fire at all!<br>
<br>
Completion of this mission brings you the next with your remaining crafts.<br>
<br>
<big><strong>THE SPY WHO LOVED ME</strong></big><br>
<br>
<strong>Mission: Destroy Stromberg's Undersea Laboratory</strong> <br>
Shipping magnate Karl Stromberg uses huge oil tankers to swallow nuclear submarines right
out of the water. It just so happens he's captured a British sub not to mention your
fellow agent Anya Amasova. Stromberg must be stopped for good. You'll find him in his
undersea laboratory off the coast of Sardinia.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rockets</strong><br>
Stromberg has rigged the ocean floor with rapid rockets that rise into the air, turn into
fire bombs, and explode on the surface line. So stay clear of the rockets, shoot them down
in flight, or bomb them out at their launch position. And eliminate or avoid the fire
bombs, too.<br>
<br>
<strong>Submarines</strong><br>
Like Drax, Stromberg has also sent a fleet of torpedo submarines to get you. As you well
know, they're killers, Bond. But you've escaped them before and you can do it again!<br>
<br>
<strong>Helicopters</strong><br>
Stromberg has sent his trigger-happy chopper pilots on a bombing mission.., and you're the
target. By the way, Bond, like Seraffino's, these choppers are indestructible, too.<br>
<br>
<strong>Oil Tankers</strong><br>
When you see one of Stromberg's oil tankers, dive under it. It's simply planted as an
obstacle in your path.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Undersea Laboratory</strong><br>
When you see Stromberg's laboratory at the bottom of the screen, lob a bomb onto it. The
explosion will release a capsule that carries Anya Amasova. Swoop down and touch the
capsule and your mission is accomplished. Stromberg is destroyed and Anya is saved. If you
should miss the laboratory (or the capsule), try again with the next one. Note: You must
touch the capsule within four seconds. Otherwise, you must try again. Also, if the capsule
floats away from you, lob a bomb onto it to make it float back again.<br>
<br>
Completion of this mission ends the game.<br>
<br>
<strong>END OF GAME</strong><br>
<br>
The game ends when you complete the last mission or when you lose the last craft. In
either case, you'll receive your final score. The following screen shows a number at the
top. This is your AGENT RATING.<br>
<br>
<strong>AGENT RATING</strong><br>
<br>
The British Secret Service rates each of its agents on his or her performance at the end
of each game. Our rating method is computer-analyzed and highly confidential. (Enemy
agents must never learn our training secrets!) The highest rating in NOVICE is 006. The
highest rating in AGENT is 007, of course!<br>
<br>
<strong>SCORING</strong><br>
<br>
Your score is displayed continuously at the top of the screen. Your final score appears at
the end of the game.<br>
