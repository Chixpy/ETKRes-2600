Bump 'n' Jump
INSTRUCTIONS 
(1 Player vs. Computer)

You're on the road, surrounded by a pack of cars. Anything goes! Bump
'em...bash 'em...crash 'em off the road...before they bump you into the 
weeds! Jump over waterways and jump on cars to smash 'em! Watch 
out for obstacles in your way. Keep driving!

THE GAME

You're at the wheel of the red car, cruising along at 20 mph. Step on it 
and speed down the roadway. Come up on the other cars and bump 
them off the road. Crash as many of them as you can.

Keep your eyes peeled for bends in the road and be ready to maneuver 
when the road narrows! Swerve to miss center islands and 
debris...jump to clear water. Quick reflexes are crucial.

Make it to the end of one roadway and you get bonus points. Then the 
game automatically begins at the next roadway.

Whenever you crash, your next car takes its place on the road. The 
game ends when all your cars crash. Start a new game and go get 'em!

CONTROLLERS
 
Use either joystick controller for this game. Be sure each controller 
cable is securely plugged into the back of your game console. Hold 
the controller so the red button is to your upper left.

NOTE: The Difficulty Switches can be set to A or B. The game plays
 exactly the same on either setting.

ACTION!

YOUR CAR
 
When the game begins, you have 5 red cars. You're driving the one on 
the road, and there are 4 others ready to roll. You lose a car each time 
you crash! You get another car each time you rack up 40,000 points.

STEERING & ACCELERATION

Use the joystick as the steering column and push it in the direction 
you want to move the car. Also use the joystick as the gas pedal. Push 
up to accelerate, push down to decelerate. It'll do from 20 to 220 mph! 
Look at the screen to see how fast you're going.

BUMPING

Try to bump other cars and send them crashing off the road. Bump with 
the front of your car and you lose speed on impact. Get bumped from 
behind and you speed up. Your car ricochets any time you make 
contact with another car. Quickly regain your course.

IUMPING

Make sure you're going at least 100 mph, then press the RED 
BUTTON. Your car gets bigger as it jumps in the air, then gets smaller 
as it lands again. The faster you're going, the farther you will jump. 
Use the joystick when you're in midair to control your landing point. 
You slow down on landing.

Jump on top of a car to crash it. Jump to clear water and to get out of 
tight situations. Try some hot shot driving by jumping to an island in 
the water, then jumping to land! (The "OK" on the screen means you're 
going over 100 mph, so you can jump!)

ROADWAYS

There are lots of different roadways. Your challenge is to keep driving 
as long as you can! Don't crash into the railings or water...drive around 
center islands and road debris.

As you approach water, you'll hear a beep and see (!) on the screen. 
Get ready to make a split second decision. Speed down the causeway 
that runs alongside the water, (if there is one)...or jump to clear the 
water!

Each time you make it to the end of a roadway you see the number of 
cars that crashed, bonus points, the roadway number you're about to 
begin, and the season you will drive through next. (The scenery along 
the roadways is a different color for Spring, Summer, Fall and 
Winter.) Then you're automatically on the next roadway.

COMPUTER CARS

There are five different types of computer cars on the road. Get to 
know 'em!

SKULL & CROSSBONE

The skull car is really aggressive. It follows you closely and you can't 
bump it very far.

TRACTOR

The tractor is very heavy and cannot be bumped very far. 

DUMP TRUCK

The dump truck sporatically dumps debris on the road. It explodes on 
contact.

RACE CARS

There are two race cars. One's green and the other is blue. You can 
bump these cars the farthest.

START A NEW GAME

When all of your cars have crashed, the game ends.  Now take your
choice.  Press RESET to start the game at the first roadway.  Or
press GAME SELECT to start the game at the last roadway you were
on.

SOUND ON/OFF

Select  COLOR to hear background music throughout the game. Select
BW to turn the music off.

You accumulate points as you drive through each roadway. The further
you drive, the more points you get. You also get 300 points for each 
car that crashes. If you make it to the  end of a roadway, you get a 
bonus of 500 points for each car that crashed! Get 50,000 bonus
points if you don't crash any cars during an entire roadway!

WINNING TIPS

* Keep your speed over 100 mph so you can jump at any time!

* Steer your car toward the center of the roadway. If you're near the 
side, you could get bumped off the road and crash!

* If you are about to crash...jump!
