<hr>

<p><strong>To Protect </strong>the electronic components of your Atari Video Game System,
be sure to switch to off when inserting or removing a cartridge for the Atari System.</p>

<p><strong>SETTING UP </strong>

<ol>
  <li>Connect your video game system to the television according to the manufacturer's
    instructions. </li>
  <li>Make sure the console is off, then firmly push in your ZiMAG video game cartridge. </li>
  <li>Now you can turn on the console. A clear image should appear on the screen. If not,
    check to see that the console is properly set up. </li>
  <li>Next, plug the joystick into the left controller jack. If you are playing a two player
    game, you will need to plug the other joystick into the right controller jack. </li>
  <li>If all of the above has been properly completed, you're ready to play. Good Luck!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>DEFENDER OF THE OUTPOST </strong></p>

<p>As the lone defender of the last remaining outpost, you are under attack by an
overwhelming force of mysterious phantom tanks that disappear and reappear at will while
destroying all that stands in their way. Your vital mission is no simple task--defend the
outpost and destroy the enemy as they advance relentlessly through your defense mazes.
Only brilliant strategy, perfectly executed can save you--and the free world. </p>

<p><strong>MOVING YOUR TANK </strong></p>

<p>Just move the joystick in the direction you want your tank to go--up to move toward the
top of the screen, left to go left and so on. Same goes for shooting. To fire at a tank
above you, you must be facing the tank. Only one bullet can be on the screen at any one
time, so fire carefully!</p>

<p><strong>GAME SELECTION GAME </strong></p>

<p><strong>GAME 1:</strong> This is the easier of two one-player games. <br>
<strong>GAME 2:</strong> This is the two-player version of Game 1. <br>
<strong>GAME 3:</strong> This is the more difficult of the two one-player games. <br>
<strong>GAME 4:</strong> This is the two-player version of Game 3. </p>

<p><strong>SCORING</strong> </p>

<p>Each enemy tank is worth 100 points. But if you sacrifice yourself by crashing into the
enemy, you receive 200 points (and the Low Sanity Medal). </p>

<p><strong>GAME FEATURES </strong></p>

<p>You start out with five tanks in each of the four variations. There are three different
screens, each one harder than the last. In the first screen, you have many walls and
corners to hide behind. In the second, you have only a small island to protect your base,
and in the third it's just you against them. </p>

<p>In each screen you must defend yourself against 20 enemy tanks. Since they're not all
on the screen at the same time, there's an indicator right under your base telling you the
enemy's remaining strength. </p>

<p>Also, at the beginning of each game, or after one of your tanks is destroyed, or at the
beginning of each scenario, the number of tanks you have left is displayed where your tank
begins. </p>

<p><strong>DEFEATING THE ENEMY </strong></p>

<p>Post yourself in the mid to lower section of the screen and wait for the enemy tanks to
approach you on a horizontal level. You can wait for them to make their move, then destroy
them. Or, if you feel adventurous, you can go up a tittle to pursue them. This strategy is
effective because it prevents the bad guys from getting close enough to destroy your base
while you're off somewhere else trying vainly to reach them. </p>
