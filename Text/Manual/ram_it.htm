<big><big>OBJECT OF THE GAME</big></big><br>
<br>
Ram all 32 color bars completely off the screen before they block you from moving or the
5000-count timer runs out.<br>
<br>
You score points for hitting the bars and score more points by hitting the flashing bonus
bars.<br>
<br>
<big><big>GETTING READY TO PLAY</big></big><br>
<br>
Play with one or two players using the Joystick Controllers. Always be sure the power is
off before inserting or removing the Ram It cartridge from your video game system. For a
one-person game use the controller plugged into the LEFT CONTROLLER jack. Hold the
controller so the red button is to your upper left. The Difficulty Switch has no effect on
this game.<br>
<br>
<big><big>TO BEGIN PLAY</big></big><br>
<br>
There are eight Ram It games (see game variations for details). The game number is
indicated on the lower right side of screen.<br>
<br>
When you first turn the game on, it plays automatically. Push the red button on the
Joystick and take control.<br>
<br>
To choose the game you wish to play, push the game select button or push the Joystick
forward. Press the game reset or push the red button on the Joystick to begin play. To
start a new game, simply push the red Joystick button.<br>
<br>
<big><big>THE SET-UP</big></big><br>
<br>
You race against the clock and against the advancing bands of color on each side. Every
time you shoot a color, it strikes a different electronic note.<br>
<br>
In games 3 through 8, you'll see flashing bonus bars from time to time. One hit clears a
flashing bar from the screen and earns you extra points. But watch out! Sometimes they'll
come up instantly on the other side. That's a Ram It!<br>
If you don't shoot fast enough, the bars meet in the center of the screen and block your
way.<br>
<br>
The clock will start to flash when it gets down to 500. Hurry, Ram faster! You need to
eliminate all the colors on the screen before the 5000-count clock runs out. Your points
for each round will show in the box at the top of the screen. If you manage to eliminate
all the bars, you win the round.<br>
<br>
But don't relax! Push the red button on the Joystick and you'll start all over. Each round
is faster than the last. They'll keep going as long as you can.<br>
<br>
You, on the other hand, just get three chances. The third time the clock runs out before
you've cleared the screen... game's over!<br>
<br>
<big><big>HOW TO PLAY</big></big><br>
<br>
You control the Ramroid located in the center of the screen. As the color bars close in on
you, try to shoot them back.<br>
Completely eliminate each bar from the screen or it will start growing toward you again.
If a bar reaches the center on only one side, maneuver around it. If this grown bar starts
to flash, go for it! A well-directed hit could clear your way once more.<br>
<br>
(NOTE: The bars grow at random, so the pattern is different<br>
every time.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Use the Joystick Controller to move the Ramroid up and down. Pushing it right or left will
determine the direction you fire in. Note that the Ramroid's laser projects out a short
distance in the direction you aim.<br>
<br>
Push the red button on your Joystick to fire the laser. Your best chance is to hold the
button down and fire continuously.<br>
<br>
<big><big>SCORING</big></big></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><br>
You score 10 points each time you hit a bar. If you get trapped or the 5000-count clock
runs out.., the round is over. Three rounds and it's curtains!<br>
<br>
If you succeed in clearing the screen, you earn the number of points remaining on the
clock, plus the points you've earned. If you don't clear the screen, you get the points
you've earned so far. Your points are added up for three rounds.<br>
<br>
<strong>Bonus Points</strong><br>
<br>
Watch for the flashing bars! You'll get extra points every time you eliminate one. The
longer the bar is, the more points you get-from 400 to 1300.<br>
<br>
BUT BE CAREFUL! THESE BONUS BARS ARE TRICKY. THEY'LL TRY TO LURE YOU AWAY FROM THE ACTION,
SO THEIR BUDDIES CAN REACH THE MIDDLE. IF YOU IGNORE THE OTHER BARS YOU'vE HAD IT.<br>
<br>
<big><big>GAME VARIATIONS</big></big></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><br>
Three starting speeds can be selected. The faster the game, the quicker the bars will come
at you, the more bonus bars you'll get, and the shorter time they'll flash. In the two
games for smaller children the color bars grow very slowly and there are no bonus bars.<br>

<big><big>HELPFUL HINTS</big></big><br>
<br>
- Ram It requires a light touch on the Joystick, so tap it<br>
gently for better control.<br>
<br>
- Concentrate on ramming the bars on one side first. Then<br>
you're less likely to get trapped.<br>
<br>
- When you're hitting two bars at once take advantage of it!<br>
Take out one side and then switch directions and take out<br>
the other.<br>
<br>
- The top and bottom bars can't block your way, so leave them alone until they turn to
bonus. Then go for the points.<br>
<br>
- Towards the end of the round, your best chance to clear<br>
the board is hitting the grown bars when they flash for the bonus. Be sure to keep one bar
&quot;alive&quot; (not grown) so you can continue to play until that happens.<br>
