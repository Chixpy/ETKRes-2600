<p>Earth Base Command Directives</p>
</b>

<p>Earth base has evoled one million years into the future. An intergalactic dispute
erupts into an all out spacial explosion time warping civilization back to the stone age.
Pitted against each other in a fight for survival is the CONDOR... Released from a
thousand millenium of extinction... Larger and more ferocious than ever imagined, and
mankind... In his most primitive state.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Defense Command Briefing</p>
</b>

<p><br>
You are in command of the only sophisticated weapon to survive the &quot;Millenium
Warp&quot;... You will be alone at this remote firebase and face a critical and difficult
mission. You must use the galactic disintegrator and all your skill and energy to defend
against this deadly invader. Carefully review these instructions, engage your equipment
and concentrate your entire attention on the battle to follow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Difficulty switches may be at either level and should not be moved during game play.</p>
  <p>Select the difficulty level that your skill and courage allows:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <div align="center"><center><table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>Left difficulty switch</td>
      <td>Right difficulty switch</td>
      <td>Earth firebase dimension</td>

      <td>B</td>
      <td>Small</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center></div><p>The larger your galactic disintegrator firebase dimensions, the harder
  it is for you to avoid being destroyed by the Condor's Attack on your weapons arsenal.</p>
  <p>Small firebases will alow quick evasion of enemy fire... This difficult decision is
  yours.</p>
  <p>Select the game you wish to play by depressing the &quot;game select&quot; switch in
  your game console. The game number will appear on the lower left hand side of the screen.</p>
  <p>When the great Condor was released from extinction, two smaller but deadlier nemesis
  were also thrown back into pre-historic time. The Nirobean Spider known for its speed in
  traversing great expanses of space and the vulcanian bat, venomous and destructive, with
  lighting agility... you can determine your choice of challenge, each has its own cunning
  and skill in directing its destruction upon your firebase.</p>

<b>

<p>Command Objectives</p>
</b>

<b>

<p>Scoring damage upon attackers</p>
</b>

<p>There are 6 galactic disintegrator firebases at your disposal. Points are scored by
destroying the enemy as they soar above or swoop in to attack you. Different points are
given for size of enemy destroyed and the level of difficulty which you have obtained in
your defense of the firebase. As your progress to each level, Condors, Spiders and Bats
will appear with varying frequency, but will increase the rate of descent and greatly vary
the pattern of attack, even disappearing on one side of the screen and reappearing on the
other side.</p>

<p>Points are scored in values as follows:</p>

<p>Upper Steady Attacker (small) 3</p>

<p>1. Level of Difficulty (large) 10</p>

<p>2. Level of Difficulty (large) 20</p>

<p>3. Level of Difficulty (large) 40</p>

<p>4. Level of Difficulty (large) 50</p>

<p>5. Level of Difficulty (large) 60</p>

<p>6. Level of Difficulty (large) 70</p>

<p>7. Level of Difficulty (large) 80</p>

<p>8. Level of Difficulty (large) 90</p>

<p>9. Level of Difficulty (large) 99</p>

<p>Extra firebases can be earned by achieving consercutive 1000 points levels (1000, 2000,
3000, 4000, etc.) up to a maximum of 9 additional firebases.</p>
