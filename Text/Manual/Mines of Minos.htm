<p><strong>Mines of Minos </strong></p>

<p>Something terrible has happened in the mazelike Mines of Minos. The smoothly running
robot operation has been interrupted by an invasion of monstrous alien life forms! Aliens
stalk the corridors of the mine; only a single robot survives to battle them. Desperately
he struggles to find and assemble pieces of his fellow robots scattered around the mine
while avoiding the pursuing aliens. If he can assemble a large enough robot army, he can
battle the aliens to fight his way down to deeper levels of the mine and even destroy the
alien command center at the lowest level. But if the aliens catch him he is doomed and his
only weapon against them is his stock of time bombs. </p>

<p>Can you avoid the monsters and assemble enough robots to expel the alien invaders from
the Mines of Minos? Find out in this latest video challenge from CommaVid. </p>

<p><strong>GETTING STARTED</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Turn off your game console. </li>
  <li>Insert Mines of Minos cartridge. </li>
  <li>Make sure both joystick controllers are firmly connected to the console (the left
    joystick is used for one player versions of the game). </li>
  <li>Turn on your game console. </li>
  <li>Select the game skill level by setting the console difficulty switches (Note on Sears
    Tele-Game, the difficulty switches are called skill switches. The &quot;a&quot; position
    is called expert, and the &quot;b&quot; position is called novice). Standard Game: Set
    both difficulty switches to &quot;b&quot;. Half Speed Monsters: Set right difficulty
    switch to &quot;a&quot;. Half Speed Robot: Set left difficulty switch to &quot;a&quot;. </li>
  <li>Select one of the 12 game variations by repeatedly pressing the game select switch. The
    game number will appear at the upper left corner of your TV screen. Refer to the Game
    Variations part of this booklet for a description of each possible game variation. </li>
  <li>Hold the joystick with the red button in the upper left. </li>
  <li>Start the game by pressing the game reset switch. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>GAME PLAY</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>Move robot through mine with left joystick. </li>
  <li>Kill monsters with time bombs. Push joystick button to drop a bomb, Only one bomb can be
    dropped at a time.</li>
  <li>Elude monsters by using tunnels at left and right side of the mine. </li>
  <li>Change mine level by holding down joystick button when moving through a tunnel. </li>
  <li>Collect robot parts to build spare robots. Carry a part to the center of either the top
    or bottom row of any level of the mine. There it is collected and added to your complement
    of spare robots.</li>
  <li>Don't spend too much time in a level because: <ul type="square">
      <li>Meaner monsters appear. </li>
      <li>Water gradually fills each level starting at the top. The water slows the robot down and
        prevents it from dropping bombs. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Don't move to a new level too quickly. Increase your power level by scoring points. If
    power level is less than mine level, it takes more than one bomb to kill a monster. </li>
  <li>Win game by destroying the three stationary monsters in the command center on level 5. A
    stationary monster is destroyed when rammed by your robot. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ADVANCED PLAY FEATURES</strong> 

<ul>
  <li>You can safely run over a half-dead or half-alive monster. A dying monster is safe to
    run over when the sound of the explosion has stopped.</li>
  <li>Some monsters can move through walls. One monster can steal a spare robot from you. You
    can see the robot jumping inside the monster. Kill the monster to regain your spare robot.</li>
  <li>Ramming a command center monster kills the robot being used. Try to have at least two
    spare robots before attacking the command center. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TWO-PLAYER GAMES</strong></p>

<p>Some of the game variations are two player games. The left joystick controls the robot
and the right joystick controls one of the monsters. Pushing the button on the right
joystick changes which monster is under the player's control. The other two monsters will
pursue the robot on their own. </p>

<p>The monster being controlled by the joystick is seen as darker in color. If the robot
runs into this monster, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. But if the robot
runs into either of the two monsters under their own control, he is destroyed as usual. </p>

<p><strong>SCORING</strong></p>

<p>Destroying a monster = 20 points. <br>
Picking up a robot part = 70 points. <br>
Depositing the robot part -- 70 points. <br>
Every 1000 points scored up to 4000 raises your power level by one unit. </p>

<p><strong>GAME VARIATIONS</strong></p>

<p><em>Game 1</em>--The standard game: It takes three robot pieces to complete a new
robot, and the flood both slows you down and keeps you from dropping a bomb.</p>

<p><em>Game 2: </em>A two-player version of Game 1. </p>

<p><em>Game 3</em>: An even greater challenge, it takes six robot pieces to complete a
robot.</p>

<p><em>Game 4: </em>A two-player version of Game 3. </p>

<p><em>Game 5:</em> For practice, it takes three robot pieces to complete a robot, but
there is no flooding.</p>

<p><em>Game 6: </em>A two-player version of Game 5. </p>

<p><em>Game 7:</em> The mine floods as usual, but it only takes two robot pieces to
complete a robot. </p>

<p><em>Game 8: </em>A two-player version of Game 7. </p>

<p><em>Game 9:</em> Three robot pieces to complete a robot, but you can drop bombs in the
flood.</p>

<p><em>Game 10:</em> A two-player version of Game 9. </p>

<p><em>Game 11:</em> The maze is invisible, except when you blow up a monster. Three robot
pieces complete a robot, and you can drop bombs in the flood.</p>

<p><em>Game 12:</em> A two-player version of Game 11. </p>

<p>Additional game variations can be created using the difficulty switches. With both
difficulty switches in the &quot;b&quot; (or novice) position, the robots and monsters
both move at normal speed. Raising the left difficulty switch to the &quot;a&quot; (or
expert) position causes the robots to move at half speed, while the right difficulty
switch in the &quot;a&quot; position causes the monsters to move at half speed. </p>
