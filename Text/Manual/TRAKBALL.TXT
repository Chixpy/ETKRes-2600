ATARI 2600

TRAK-BALL CONTROLLER

OWNER'S MANUAL

MODEL NO. CX22


------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT:  Read this Owner's Manual before setting up
your ATARI 2600 TRAK-BALL console.



INTRODUCTION





Congratulations on the purchase of your ATARI 2600 TRAK-
BALL controller.  Now you can have arcade action in your 
own living room- simply connect your TRAK-BALL controller
to your game console, plug in any Joystick-compatible
game program, and you're ready to go!  Your TRAK-BALL
offers great game-playing features:  360 degree move-
ment, precise player control, and instant starts and stops.
You'll especially see the difference with fast-action Atari
games, like MISSILE COMMAND, CENTIPEDE, YARS'
REVENGE, DEFENDER, and GALAXIAN.  With the 2600
TRAK-BALL controller, Atari brings arcade action home
to stay!





USING YOUR TRAK-BALL





SET UP





For one-player games, plug your TRAK-BALL into the LEFT
CONTROLLER jack.  For two-player games, plug an addi-
tional TRAK-BALL into the RIGHT CONTROLLER jack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------





For optimal performance, set your TRAK-BALL controller on
a level surface such as a table or floor.  If the controller is
tilted too far in any direction, it may interfere with the con-
troller's performance.





TRAK-BALL ACTION





Since your TRAK-BALL controller has two fire buttons- one
on each side of the rotating ball- the controller can be
used with the right or left hand.





You can move players in any direction on the screen with
your 2600 TRAK-BALL controller.  To move a player quickly,
spin the ball rapidly in the desired direction.  To stop move-
ment, simply halt the TRAK-BALL.





NOTE:  The rolling action of the TRAK-BALL should become
smoother with use.





CARE AND MAINTENANCE





Your ATARI 2600 TRAK-BALL controller will bring you many
years of enjoyment.  To keep it in good working condition,
please remember the following:







•To protect the precision-engineered design of your
   TRAK-BALL, always play with clean hands.  Keep the ball
   clean by wiping it frequently with a soft dry cloth.

•Do not spill liquids on the controller.  Liquids can easily
   seep down around the ball, resulting in slow-down and
   poor response.  If liquids are spilled on the TRAK-BALL,
   have your controller serviced as soon as possible.

•Do not lift the TRAK-BALL by its connecting cord.  This
   could bend or crimp the wires and break the internal
   insulation.

•Be careful not to drop your TRAK-BALL or subject it to
   sudden jolts.

•Do not expose the console to extreme high or low
   temperatures.

•Clean the exterior surface of the console with a soft,
   slightly damp cloth.

•Unplug your controller when not in use.
