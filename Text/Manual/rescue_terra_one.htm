<p>crystals. These crystals supply 72% of Earth&#146;s energy.<br>
Terra I is managed by a highly sophisticated computer<br>
system which controls all planetary electromechanical<br>
equipment, including the robot driven defense system.<br>
<br>
. . . Apparently, Terra I&#146;s computer system has been<br>
sabotaged. All crystal shipments are being turned over<br>
to space pirates who operate in Terra I&#146;s quadrant of the<br>
universe. Terra I&#146;s own defense systems are being used<br>
to aid these pirates in their activities.<br>
<br>
. . . Your orders are to proceed to Terra I. Destroy all<br>
pirates and electromechanical systems which pose a<br>
threat to your ship.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RECONNAISSANCE REPORT</b><br>
<br>
You will be assigned the fleets&#146; newest and most<br>
sophisticated fighter, the F-711 Starwarrior. This ship<br>
is equipped with laser cannons and a computerized<br>
navigational system which constantly calculates the<br>
distance in light years to your ultimate objective.<br>

<p><br>
<br>
<b>METEOR STORM</b> -- radar reports indicate that you will<br>
encounter a meteor storm 39,999 light years from Terra I. The<br>
meteors exhibit sporadic movement caused by<br>
electromagnetic disturbances. Destroy all meteors!<br>
<br>
<b>SPACE PIRATES</b> -- Intelligence indicates heavy space<br>
pirate activity 29,999 light years from Terra I. The space<br>
pirates man slow cargo ships which travel on a straight<br>
course. These are fairly easy targets, but they are armed with<br>
laser cannons. The pirates protect their cargo ships with fast<br>
moving fighter saucers which accelerate in random<br>
directions. These fighter saucers are extremely dangerous.<br>
Evasive flight is recommended when necessary.<br>
<br>
<b>ROBOT INTERCEPTORS</b> -- You will encounter robot<br>
interceptors 19,999 light years from Terra I. This is Terra I&#146;s<br>
primary planetrary defense. The two types of interceptors are<br>
missile shaped and saucer shaped. Both types exhibit erratic<br>
movement and are extremely difficult to hit due to their low<br>
profile. Saucer shaped interceptors are armed with photon<br>
bombs which make them more dangerous than the missile<br>
shaped interceptors.<br>
<br>
<b>FISH FORCE FIELDS</b> -- You will encounter fish force fields<br>
9,999 light years from Terra I. These are Terra I&#146;s last line of<br>
defense. Fish shaped devices will emit glowing force fields<br>
that will continually advance on your position. The only way<br>
to knock out the force field is to fly close to the field and<br>
attack the fish shaped device with your laser.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>SCORING &amp; DISTANCE</b><br>
<br>
The F-711 has 5 shield at the start of each mission. One is in<br>
use and four are in reserve. One shield will be lost when you<br>
are hit and one shield will be gained for each 10,000 points<br>
scored.<br>
<br>
</p>

<pre>
     Meteor              125 points
     Cargo Ship	         225 points
     Fighter Saucer	 275 points
     Robot Interceptor   425 points
     Fish Force Field    650 points
</pre>

<p><br>
<br>
A two tone sound signals the beginning of each wave. If an<br>
obstacle gets by it will appear on the screen again. In order<br>
to advance to the next wave and get closer to Terra I, you<br>
must destroy all obstacles without being hit. If you are hit,<br>
not only do you lose a shield, but you must start the wave<br>
over. Your navigational system will recalculate your distance<br>
to Terra I.<br>
<br>

6. Difficulty Levers<br>
<br>
The difficulty levers do not affect game play.<br>
<br>
7. TV TYPE Switch<br>
<br>
Rescue Terra I is designed to operate on either black and<br>
white or color TV without the use of the TV Type Switch.<br>
The TV Type Switch has been converted to a pause<br>
switch. If you are interrupted during game play, you may<br>
flip the TV Type Switch, and the game will hold after the<br>
current wave is completed. The pause mode is not<br>
designed to be used for long periods of time. When you<br>
are ready to continue, flip the TV Type Switch to the<br>
opposite setting.<br>

<b>GAME MISSIONS</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<b></p>

<pre>
    1 Player   2 Players   Description

Mission #1        #6	   Entire Mission
        #2        #7	   Meteor Storm Only
        #3        #8	   Space Pirates Only
        #4        #9	   Robot Interceptors Only
        #5        #10      Fish Force Fields Only
</b></pre>

<p><br>
The F-711 Starwarrior navigational system is only<br>
operational during Mission #1 and #6.<br>
<br>
All two player missions are team efforts. The left controller<br>
will move the F-711 left and right only. The right controller<br>
will move the craft up and down only. Fire power is<br>
controlled alternatively by both controllers. The right<br>
controller fires for 2 seconds, then the left controller for 2<br>
seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>PROBABILITY OF MISSION SUCCESS</b><br>
<br>
Your chances of success are slim but not impossible.<br>
Strategic flight Wing Command estimates that only one<br>
pilot in a thousand can reach Terra I. But ...you are the best;<br>
that&#146;s why you were chosen. Good luck!<br>
