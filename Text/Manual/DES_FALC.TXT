DESERT FALCON

by ATARI
c 1988


A DARING DESERT QUEST FOR TREASURE!
-----------------------------------

All around you are long stretches of sand, ancient pyramids baking in
the hot dead air, and constant danger.

The legends that brought you here are 30 centuries old.  The tales tell
of thieves who plundered the Pharaoh's tomb, loading bags of gold,
silver, and precious gems onto their camels, then making off into the
desert.  But in the night, horrible desert beasts pursued the robbers,
and the priceless treasure was scattered and lost.  Not even a camel
was ever seen again.

Now you search for the lost treasure, daring the beaks and claws of the
desert guardians.  As you scan the endless sand for the glitter of
jewels, your eye catches sight of gliding shadows.  Something's coming!

You could turn back now and be safe.  Or you could go on, and dare to
steal the Pharaoh's jewels.


GETTING STARTED

1. Insert the Desert Falcon cartridge into your Atari 2600 or 7800(TM)  
   console.

2. For one player, plug a joystick into the left controller jack.  For  
   two players, plug a second joystick into the right controller jack.

3. Turn on your television, then press the [Power] button to turn on    
   your console.  The Desert Falcon title and options screen appears.

4. Select game options by pressing [Select] or by using the left        
   joystick.  Move the joystick handle up or down to choose one of four 
   skill levels: Novice (easiest), Standard, Advanced, or Expert (most  
   difficult) and to choose between a one- or two-player game.  An      
   option is selected when it lights up.

5. Press [Reset] or the left joystick's fire button to start the game.

6. Press [Select] to redisplay the options screen at any time.


GAME PLAY

The Pharaoh's lost treasures--enormous gems, big golden eggs, and
silver ingots--are scattered among the ancient pyramids and obelisks. 
Fly towards the treasures, then hover or hop over them to pick them up
and earn points.  Use your joystick handle to maneuver.  (Follow the
chart above.)

The treasures are guarded by flying and crawling beasts.  Burrowing
Uwes crawl out of the sand to charge at you, and Vultures, Warrior
Phleas, Scarabs, Flying Fish, and Phantom Gliders attack from the air. 
Darts fly at you, spit our by the Howling Sphinx waiting at the end of
the trail.  All these enemies will destroy you if they hit you.

Protect yourself by firing darts.  A direct hit destroys enemy
creatures and gains you points.  You can also maneuver around enemies. 
At higher levels, watch out for flame-throwing Fire Pots and dart-
shooting Mini-Sphinxes.

You begin the game with five lives.  Each time you're hit or you crash
into an object you lose a life, but you will recover as long as you
have lives left.

The end of each desert trek brings you to the Howling Sphinx.  You must
shoot this Sphinx in the middle of its face in order to get past it,
all the while dodging the darts and nasty creatures it spits at you.

SUPER POWERS

Hop over any three hieroglyphs scattered in the sand to gain super
powers.  Super powers give you great advantages, such as letting you
destroy all enemies on screen at once or paralyze the Howling Sphinx.

Check the Gaming Box at the bottom of the screen to find out which
power you've gained and whether if requires pressing the fire button
twice quickly ("DBL-PRESS").  Some powers will be used up when you
double-press the fire button; other powers last for about 20 seconds. 
A new power is awarded when you pick up three more hieroglyphs, whether
or not the previous power was used.

There are many super powers for you to discover (some of them are
described on the next page).  But beware: in the higher levels of play
you can earn super problems, such as Shackles, as well as super powers.

Gaming Box [Image of the box below the game screen.  The Current Score
is in the upper right corner.  The score of Player 1 is on top, and the
score of player two is on the bottom.  Below the score, and in the
middle, is the current Super Power the player possesses.  Below this is
the Lives Remaining and Hieroglyphs Picked Up.  The Lives Remaining of
Player 1 is on the left, the Hieroglyphs Picked Up is in the middle,
and the Lives Remaining of Player 2 is on the right.  On the left side
of the bottom line, the Base Value per Treasure is shown.  On the right
side of the bottom line, the Value Multipliers are shown.]

DESTROYING THE HOWLING SPHINX

First Sphinx.............................................. 5,000 points
Each additional Sphinx......... previous Sphinx score plus 1,000 points
                                          (up to 10,000 points maximum)


STEALING TREASURES

During regular game play, each treasure you pick up earns you the base
value, plus increase that treasure's value multiplier by 1.  In the
bonus round, each treasure is worth the base value times its value
multiplier.


BONUS LIVES

You earn a bonus life at every 10,000 points scored.  You can have a
maximum of four lives remaining.


BONUS ROUND

Destroying the Howling Sphinx gains you entrance to the bonus round. 
Here your goal is to pick up as many treasures as you can in the time
allowed.

During the bonus round, your time allowed is counted down in seconds in
the Gaming Box.  The bonus score is tallied next to the time.  When the
round ends, the bonus score is added to your current score.  The last
hieroglyphs or super power you gained reappear along with your
remaining lives.

You are not attacked in the bonus round, and colliding with objects
will not cost you a life; only time is lost.


STRATEGY

Gauge the altitude of flying beasts by watching their shadows.

Figure out what combination of hieroglyphs awards you which power.  For
instance, the combination "Bird, Cane, Bowl" gives you Warp (except at
Novice level) while the combination "Cane, Bird, Bowl" (the same
hieroglyphs in a different order) gives you Air Bomb.  Pick up a
particular combination when its power will do you the most good.

In the bonus round, go for the treasures that have the highest value
multiplier.

Gaming Box [Image of the box below the game screen.  On the bottom
line, from left to right, are: Base Value per Treasure, Gem Value
Multiplier, Golden Egg Value Multiplier, and Silver Ingot Value
Multiplier.  The line above the bottom line contains, from left to
right: Time Allowed and Bonus Score.
