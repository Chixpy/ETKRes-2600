BMX Air Master

Instruction Manual for the Atari 2600



TNT Games





Thank you for purchasing BMX Air Master.  Please read this instruction
manual carefully so that you can fully enjoy this game.





BMX Air Master is a one or two player game.
The main goal is to perform as many ticks and combinations and score
as many points as possible.  Your attempts for tricks per game are
limited so you've got to be good.





There are three different events to the game:





1.  Half Pipe

2.  Quarter Pipe

3.  Ramp Jump and Landing.






GETTING STARTED

===============






BMX Air Master has 4 modes:





1.  Practice standard

2.  Practice advanced

3.  Arcade standard

4.  Arcade advanced






To select the mode, use the select button on the console or the left
joystick.  To begin a game, use the reset button on the console of the
fire button on the joystick.





In a 2 player game, use the right difficulty switch to choose between
using one or two joysticks (only one player may play at one time).





Practice Mode

-------------

If you're going to be great, you've got to practice.  This mode allows
you to switch and practice events.  After you have completed the
selected event, the game will reset and allow you to try another
event.  Press right on the joystick to select an event, then press the
fire button to start.





Arcade Mode

-----------

Now it's time to test your skill.





The idea here is to survive through as many events as you can.  When
your lives are gone, the game is over.  In each round after the ramp
jump has been completed you will be awarded an extra man.  In the next
round the difficulty will increase.  The number of lives is indicated
at the bottom of the screen, L = Lives.





GAME PLAY

=========






Half Pipe

---------

To start the stage press the fire button.  Pedal your bike by moving
the joystick left and right.  You will need to pick up speed fast in
order to get into the air.





The bike cannot leave the ramp while backwards.  Use the fire button to
turn the bike around.  While you're in the air:  Try to perform as many
tricks as possible (see chart).  The time limit is 90 seconds; when
time is running out a tone will warn you.





Quarter Pipe

------------

This even is similar to the half pipe, but this time you have only 3
attempts.  Use the ramp to gain speed and concentrate on a certain
trick or combo.





The Ramp Jump

-------------

This one's bigger than the fountain at Caesars!  You've got three
chances to make the jump.  Again, the idea is to perform as many aerial
tricks as possible for points. 500 bonus points will be awarded by
landing on the ramp.





SCORING:  Points are awarded each time a trick is performed.  More
points are awarded the first time a trick is performed in each event.
Combinations of tricks are possible and bonus points can be earned
(see chart).

HINTS

=====






Remember that a safe landing is very important -- while in the air,
prepare your bike by making sure the wheels land on the ramp and not
your head.





When leaving the half or quarter pipe ramp, hold the joystick up or
down.  This will move your player left or right.  By doing this you can
actually land on the top of the ramp.





When the first 3 events are completed, round two will begin again with
the half pipe.  This difficulty will increase.





Harder Stages

-------------

As difficulty increases you must land on the ramps at the correct
angle. make sure you land correctly.





Also, the pedal force and gravity will increase so you must pedal
harder to reach the highest areas.
