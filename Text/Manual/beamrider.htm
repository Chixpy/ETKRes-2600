3D..... DARK, DANGEROUS, DEMANDING<br>
<br>
B E A M R I D E R<br>
<br>
A beam matrix of iridescent blue engulfs the distant blackness of <br>
Earth-Space. You stand watching. First mesmerized, you now realise the beams <br>
carry weapons. Frightening creations in endless configurations. Intriguing <br>
to watch, but will you -- yes you, dear reader -- take action? You will??!! <br>
Then roll up your sleeves, mount these beams and.....ride!!<br>
<br>
Animated graphics create a 3-D perspective that virtually pulls you<br>
into the screen. Pulsating sound effects intensify the constant array of<br>
new objects that zip from beam to beam. Beamrider combines tomorrow's<br>
technology with designer Dave Rolfe's fantastic imagination to forge the<br>
challenge you'll return to again and again!<br>

BEAMRIDER<br>
GAME PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS<br>
<br>
The Restrictor Shield, 99 sectors deep, now surrounds the Earth. You<br>
are the Beamrider, on a mission to clear the Shield. There you must demolish<br>
an onslaught of alien frights as you dodge from beam to beam. Sector after<br>
sector, the deluge deepens.....<br>
<br>
INITIAL SET-UP<br>
<br>
1. Insert cartridge into your game system with the power OFF. Then turn <br>
power ON.<br>
<br>
2. 2600 users, skip to number 10.<br>
<br>
3. Select number of players by pressing the appropriate number, 1-4, on<br>
controller keypad.<br>
<br>
4. Select level of difficulty by pressing it's corresponding number on the<br>
keypad.<br>
<br>
level: Begins at sector:<br>
1 1 <br>
2 5<br>
3 10<br>
<br>
You will immediately be in the Space Station. It's control panel <br>
displays your score, two reserve ships, sector, number of enemy saucers<br>
in sector and three torpedoes.<br>
<br>
5. To start the action, move the Control Stick up. The hatch doors will <br>
open, thrusting you through hyperspace to the Restrictor Shield.<br>
<br>
6. Your Light Ship will move left or right when you move the Control Stick<br>
left or right. To fire laser lariats, press the left side button. To<br>
fire torpedoes, press the right side button.<br>
<br>
7. To begin a new game at any time, press Reset on the game console.<br>
<br>
8. Pause the action whenever you like by pressing zero (0) on the hand<br>
controller. Screen will go black. To resume the game, press any other<br>
key.<br>
<br>
9. To drop out of a multi-player game without interrupting the other <br>
players, press 5 on the hand controller when your turn begins. Your<br>
score will be omitted and the sequence of play will adjust to the<br>
remaining players.<br>
<br>
10. On the 2600: Press reset and move Joystick to start the action. Laser<br>
lariats are fired by pressing the red button: to fire torpedoes, push<br>
Joystick forward.<br>
<br>
11. Use the left difficult switch to select 2600 level of difficulty:<br>
A=Advanced, B=Basic.<br>
<br>
12. Turn power OFF before removing cartridge.<br>
<br>
<br>
BEAM BEARINGS<br>
<br>
The Space Station: Whenever your ship is destroyed or when you complete<br>
a sector, you will return via hyperspace to the space station. When you're<br>
ready to continue, move the Control Stick up. The hatch doors will open and<br>
you'll be on your way. The Space Station does not appear in the 2600 version.<br>
<br>
Enemy Saucers: There are 15 enemy saucers in each sector. They all must be<br>
destroyed before you can go to the next sector. Every time a saucer is hit,<br>
the number in the upper left corner of the screen will count down by one.<br>
<br>
The Sector Sentinel: When all 15 white enemy saucers have been destroyed<br>
in a sector, their Sentinel ship will cruise across the top of the beams.<br>
Only a torpedo can destroy it.<br>
<br>
Weapons: Laser lariats are only effective against certain invaders (see<br>
&quot;Dangerous Encounters&quot;). Torpedoes, however, will destroy the first object<br>
they meet on a beam. You are only given 3 torpedoes per sector. Use them<br>
sparingly since they are your only weapon against the Sector Sentinel.<br>
<br>
Yellow Rejuvenators. Occasionally, yellow rejuvenators will float through<br>
the beam matrix. Allow them to land on your deck, as each connection will add<br>
a bonus ship to your fleet. If you shoot or torpedo a rejuvenator by mistake,<br>
it will turn red from the heated blast. Get out of the way! The wreckage will<br>
destroy you on contact.<br>
<br>
<br>
DANGEROUS ENCOUNTERS<br>
<br>
With the first swing of your laser lariat, the white enemy saucers <br>
approach. But there's more. As you progress through the Restrictor Shield a<br>
sinister collection of aliens will materialize. A new danger is added with<br>
every other sector, up to sector 16:<br>
<br>
SECTOR CRAFT VULNERABLE<br>
1 White Enemy Saucers Yes<br>
2 Brown Space Debris No<br>
4 Yellow Chirper Ships Yes<br>
6 Green Blocker Ships No<br>
8 Green Bounce Craft No<br>
10 Blue Chargers Yes<br>
12 Orange Trackers No<br>
14 Red Zig Bombs Yes \ not in 2600<br>
16 Magnetic Mines No / version<br>
<br>
<br>
Only &quot;vulnerable&quot; objects are affected by laser lariats (saucers and<br>
chirpers are destroyed; chargers and zig bombs are deflected). Everything<br>
else can only be dodged or, in extreme cases, torpedoed. Magnetic Mines will<br>
pull you over unless you keep moving the Control Stick in the direction<br>
opposite the mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
SCORING<br>
<br>
Points are scored each time an enemy saucer, chirper ship or Sector<br>
Sentinel is destroyed. Point values increase as you progress to higher<br>
sectors.<br>
<br>
The exact point value for each hit appears in red, briefly replacing<br>
your score the moment an enemy craft is destoyed (on Coleco version only).<br>
<br>
Also, if you manage to destroy the Sector Sentinel, you'll receive an<br>
additional bonus for each ship in your fleet.<br>

<br>
HOW TO BE A &quot;BEAMRIDER&quot;<br>
<br>
Greetings from sector 26 and moving! If you want to make it to the outer<br>
sectors, pay attention to these tips.<br>
<br>
Maintain precise control by learning to TAP the Control Stick to move<br>
your ship a single beam at a time. And stay near the centre beams so you<br>
won't get boxed into a corner with nowhere to run.<br>
<br>
Zap the white enemy saucers as early in their approach as possible. And<br>
check this out: You can hit them when they're slightly off the beam, before<br>
they can drop their missiles.<br>
<br>
When you see a yellow rejuvenator, don't abandon all caution as you move<br>
to catch it or you'll likely wreck your ship. If an enemy object is blocking<br>
the rejuvenator, you can use a torpedo to blast it out of the way. Then, <br>
catch the rejuvenator. But remember, you only have three torpedoes and <br>
they're your only weapon against the Sector Sentinel.<br>
<br>
And while we're on the subject, when the Sentinel is about to approach,<br>
don't sit on the beam you plan to shoot from. Green Blockers will swarm on<br>
to it immediately! Instead, wait on a beam you're not going to shoot from<br>
(like the one nearest the Sentinel's first sighting). As soon as the Blockers<br>
are `locked' onto that beam, zip over to an unblocked beam and torpedo the<br>
ship.<br>
<br>
Last, but not least, take time to notice the enemy attack movements. <br>
They generally follow a pattern of motion that allows you to anticipate many<br>
of their moves.<br>
