PATROL COMMUNIQUE 4024/8:  Friendly robot freighter downed on planetoid
Beta-7 in your quadrant.
 
CARGO:  Valuable trimetalisium energy crystals.  Enemy star cruiser with
fighter drones enroute to confiscate these highly valuable blue energy
crystals.
 
MISSION:  Recover as many crystals as possible.  Destroy all enemy fighter
drones you encounter.  Intelligence reports that enemy is combat testing new
models of these drones and will periodically replace them during melee.
 
MISSION STATUS:  Critical.  Expect extreme danger when penetrating orange
atmosphere of Beta-7 planetoid.  The energy crystals have ionized the gases
to such an extent that your horizontal drives will be useless: you may not be
able to move left or right at low altitudes.  No further communication
authorized.  Good Hunting.

1.  Plug in Joystick or Ball Controller
 
2.  Turn power OFF, insert game cartridge.
 
3.  Turn power ON.
 
4.  DIFFICULTY SWITCHES are not used with STAR FOX since the enemy
automatically becomes more aggressive as your score increases.
 
5.  JOYSTICK CONTROLLERS move your space ship in any direction.  When you
enter the orange atmosphere your landing gear will automatically deploy.  You
will not be able to move left or right while in the planet's atmosphere.  The
red button on the joystick fires your laser cannon.
 
6.  BALL CONTROLLERS work very well with STAR FOX.  Higher scores should be
possible.
 
7.  GAME SELECT SWITCH will allow you to choose the

difficulty level and whether one or two players will be playing.
 
 
  Man + Happy Face + Blank      Practice mode - One player only, no scoring
 
  Man + Blank      + Blank      First Level One Player - Scoring for
                                successfully shooting or ramming enemy and
                                for recovering crystals.
 
  Man + Blank      + Man        First Level Two Players  - Play alternates
                                starting with left controller.
 
  Man + Diamond    + Blank      Second Level, One Player - Scoring for
                                successfully shooting enemy and for recoving
                                crystals.  Colliding with enemy will cause
                                you to loose a life.
 
  Man + Diamond    + Man        Second level, Two Players
 
8.  BEGIN PLAY by pressing the game reset button or by pressing the red button
on your controller.  After each loss of a life, a controller symbol will
appear at the top of the screen.  Pressing the red button on your controller
will restart the game.
 
Once you have pressed the read button, you are free to being searching for
crystals.  They are always located just off the screen to the left or right.
Flying in one direction then turning around and flying in the other direction
is the best way to find crystals.
 
9.  SCORING is done by destroying enemy fighters and recovering blue
trimetalisium crystals.  To destroy a fighter drone you may shoot it with your
LASER or ram it.  Be careful in the second level of difficulty;  your ship is
destroyed if you ram the enemy.
 
SCORES:
        Ram enemy               10 points
        Shoot enemy            100 points
        Recover crystal        200 points

10.  LIVES remaining in addition to your current life are displayed at the top
of the screen.  You have a total of four lives at the beginning of each game.
 
11.  DIFFICULTY is determined automatically.  As your score increases the
enemy becomes faster.  Your opponent is replaced automatically every 2000
points or so, depending upon the tactics programmed into the enemy.  All but
the most difficult enemy drones are available in the practice mode as well.
In this mode, pressing RESET switch will return you to the easiest enemy.
Each successive fighter drone is more difficult to shoot than the last.  Only
the best players will get a chance to see some of the most aggressive units.
 
                                 H I N T S
 
Your search for crystals will be greatly reduced by flying rapidly to the
right or to the left.  If you do not come across a crystal within a few
seconds reverse direction.  This will generally being a crystal into view
almost immediately.
 
You are most vulnerable when within Beta-7's atmosphere while recovering the
trimetalisium crystals.  Since trimetalisium possesses an extraordinary
amount of energy, they float above the surface of Beta-7.  To reduce the time
you must remain within the atmosphere wait until the crystal is near the top
of the gaseous layer.  It is also helpful to dive into the atmosphere at an
angle instead of dropping stright down.  Since your landing gear will deploy
automatically as soon as your ship's sensors detect Beta-7's atmosphere gases
you will decelerate very rapidly.  Pick-up the crystal and ascend to thinner
air.

STAR FOX by Mythicon has a high level of computer intelligence built in.  The
enemy is very smart and always knows where you are.  It has an automatic
tracking system which tells at what altitude you are flying, what airspeed
your are maintaining and your rate of acceleration and deceleration.
 
Because of the extraordinary sensing devices aboard, a fighter drone is
capable of detecting your exery motion, except when bombing.  It will attempt
to evade your LASER cannon and reestablish an attack position behind your
ship.  Its sensors will also detect your entry into Beta-7's atmosphere.
While you are recovering the trimetalisium crystals it will assume a bombing
mode since it is not constructed to survive the ionized gases of the
atmosphere.  In this mode it will detect your location, hover above you, and
release tactical bombs.  When you rise out of the atmospheric level, it re-
assumes its attack mode and the firing of its missles.
