     As a captain of ships sailing on seas, how would you react if there is
no more peace on seas? Polution has caused the unknown monsters in sea which 
attack all the ships mercilessly. Being a sea-lover, of course you would arm 
your ship with torpedoes or deep-sea bombs and take the mission to destroy 
three kinds of active seamonsters in the waters of different levels. You
get six ships, but be careful, the monsters are extremely tricky.

1. Follow manufacturer's instructions to hook up your video game system.
2. Turn power off, plug in your cartridge.
3. Turn power on; picture appears on the screen.
4. Plug your controllers into the controller connectors and hold the 
   controllers with red button at upper left while playing.
5. Difficulty switch has no effect in SEAMONSTER.
6. Select game with game select switch. The game No. would appear on the
   upper right of the screen, and the No. on the upper left indicates the
   game is for one player or two players.

   Game Number                    Player                     Speed
        1                           1                        slow
        2                           2                        slow
        3                           1                       average
        4                           2                       average
        5                           1                        fast
        6                           2                        fast

7. To Begin Play:

   Press your game reset switch, the game No. would turn to indicate the
   quantity of the ships you own. Push your Joystick up, one of your ships
   will appear on the sea level; the game starts.

8. Piloting:

   Your ship is piloted by moving the Joystick to left or right two 
   directions.

9. Firing:

   Move your ship to aim at a seamonster and press the red button to fire
   your bomb. If your ship was struck by seamonster unfortunately, you have
   to press the Joystick to top again, thus, another ship from your remain
   ships would appear once more.

10.Scoring:

   Your score is shown on the top centre of the screen. You are awarded for
   every monster you have destroyed. Monsters are active in three levels:

         Topmost          10 points
         Middle           50 points
         Lower level      30 points

   For every 1000 points you score, you will be given one more ship, unless
   the screen has indicated 9 ships. Whenever your score is calculated over
   999,990, it would be accounted from zero again.
