1. A SAVAGE PROBLEM

Let me introduce myself: Sir Dudley Dashly is the name, and big-game 
hunting is my game. It was, anyway, until yesterday afternoon at 4:00 
(teatime, you know) when my wife, Lady Penelope Dashly (Lady P. for 
short) was kidnapped from camp. It simply ruined my whole tea service! 
Seems that a couple of savages saw Lady P. and decided to cook her up 
for their own tea!

Soon after Penelope was captured, the jungle drums started beating. My 
porters translated the message - they tell me it's some sort of jungle memo:

TO: THE CANNIBAL COMMUNITY
FROM: THE CANNIBAL RESTAURANT SOCIETY
RE: TEATIME

WE HAVE A SPECIAL ON TODAY'S MENU! OUR SOUP DU JOUR 
IS ENGLISHWOMAN BROTH, MADE FRESH TODAY AND 
SERVED PROMPTLY AT 4:00. DON'T MISS THIS SPECIAL 
TEATIME TREAT, BROUGHT OVERSEAS FROM THE WILDS OF 
ENGLAND!

DIRECTIONS TO TODAYS MEAL ARE AS FOLLOWS: TAKE 
ELEVEN VINES THROUGH THE DEADLY FOREST, TURN RIGHT 
INTO THE REPTILE RIVER, GO PAST FOURTEEN CROCODILES 
AND EMERGE ON THE DGE OF THE BOULDER FIELD. RUN 
THROUGH THE BOULDER FIELD UNTIL YOU REACH THE 
CANNIBAL CAMP.  JUMP PAST THE TWO GUARDS <WATCH 
OUT FOR SPEAR TIPS!>, TURN LEFT, AND ... YOU'RE THERE! 
BON APPETIT!


2. GAME PLAY


The object of JUNGLE HUNT is to rescue Sir Dashly's kidnapped
mate, who, after hours of valiant fighting, was overpowered by two
man-eating (and woman-eating) savages.

To rescue Lady P., you'll have to make your way past four sets of
obstacles: the vines of the Forest, the crocodiles of Reptile River, a 
landslide of bouncing boulders, and the spears of the two masked 
cannibals. You'll score points for each obstacle Sir Dashly successfully 
overcomes; you'll also score bonus points for rescuing Lady P.

Since jungle hunting is a dangerous business, you are given five lives at 
the start of the game. The number of lives remaining is shown on the 
upper left of your  screen (see Figure 1). At 10,000 points you are given 
one extra life - if you survive that long!

When you begin the game you are given 500 seconds to reach Lady
Penelope. A timer counts down the seconds until you reach her (see
Figure 1). You'll score more bonus points for rescuing her quickly, so
don't dawdle while you're jumping vines or avoiding crocodiles.

The obstacles you'll encounter on your adventure are:

DEADLY
FOREST

The Deadly Forest is a swinging place once you get to know it. Here you'll 
test your coordination and timing as you jump from vine to vine. Since 
some vines swing faster than others, you'll have to time your leaps 
carefully. Make a wrong move, and Sir Dashly is finished !

REPTILE
RIVER

The Reptile River is filled with schools of cantankerous crocodiles. Make 
Sir Dashly swim out of their way or fend them off with his knife. Beware 
of any crocodile with its mouth fully open - his knife will be useless 
against it.

Most of the crocodiles swim in groups of three, but occasionally you'll 
find a rogue crocodile swimming alone. Rogue crocodiles are worth more 
points than other crocodiles. Watch out for them! They swim more 
erratically than the other crocodiles, and often drop down when you least 
expect it.

Use your Joystick to steer Dudley underwater, but keep your eyes on
the air meter at the top of your screen (see Figure 1). If Dudley is still 
underwater when the meter runs out, he'll have to breath water - and you'll 
lose a life!

BOULDER
FIELD

After you successfully cross Reptile River, you'll encounter a landslide of 
tumbling boulders. There are two sizes of boulders: small rolling rocks and 
larger bouncing boulders. Leap over the small rocks to avoid getting 
crushed. Larger boulders are harder to avoid - you'll have to leap over, run 
under, or duck beneath them to keep out of their way.

CANNIBAL   
CAMP

You're finally within reach of Lady Penelope, but she's being guarded by 
spear-wielding savages. You must guide our hero over the spears of the 
savages and run to the waiting arms of Lady Penelope. Watch out for the 
tips of the spears. They're poisoned !

After a tearful reunion with his beloved wife Sir Dashly returns to the 
Deadly Forest for the next level of play. The game becomes increasingly 
difficult as you move on to higher levels. You can continue to play until 
you run out of players, or until the timer runs out.


3. USING THE CONTROLLER

Use your Joystick controller with this ATARI Game Program cartridge. 
Be sure the controller cable is firmly plugged into the LEFT 
CONTROLLER jack at the back of your console. Hold the Joystick with 
the red controller button to your upper left toward the television screen. 
(See your owner's manual for further details.)

Use your Joystick controller to maneuver Dudley through the jungle:

DEADLY FOREST

Use the red button to make Dudley jump from vine to vine. At the end of 
the forest, press the button to enter Reptile River.

REPTILE RIVER

Use the Joystick to move Dudley any direction in Reptile River. Use the 
red button to stab crocodiles.

BOULDER FIELD

Use the Joystick to make Dudley run forward and backward. To make 
Dudley duck beneath a boulder, simply pull back on the Joystick. Make 
Dudley jump over boulders by pressing the red button.

CANNIBAL CAMP

Use the Joystick to run Dudley back and forth; use the red button to make
Dudley jump over the cannibals.


4. CONSOLE CONTROLS

GAME RESET SWITCH

Use the GAME RESET switch to start the game, or to restart the game at 
any time during game play. The red controller button can also be used to 
start a new game.

GAME SELECT SWITCH

Use the GAME SELECT switch to select one of two skill levels. The
skill level number is shown at the upper left of the screen, where Sir
Dashly's remaining lives are shown during game play.

expert (more difficult) version. Select Skill Level 1 to play the easy 
version, or Skill Level 2 to play the more difficult version.

6. STRATEGY
	      
*	The faster you rescue Lady P. the more bonus points you'll receive, 
so don't waste any time getting to her. The Deadly Forest can be especially 
time-consuming practice jumping from vine to vine as quickly as possible.

*	A crocodile's underbelly is particularly vulnerable, try to come from 
beneath when stabbing one.

*	Since rogue crocodiles are worth up to three times more points
than the crocodiles swimming in groups, try to stab them when
possible. Watch out, though! The rogues move more erratically than
the other crocodiles, and can easily hit you before you're ready.

*	If you wish to conserve lives, simply avoid the crocodiles instead
of stabbing them.

*	For an extra lift when jumping over boulders and cannibals, push
your Joystick forward after you make Sir Dashly jump. Not only will he 
jump higher, but he'll also stay aloft longer.

*	To score extra points, try jumping over the large boulders. You'll
get up to four times more points than ducking or running beneath them. 
Time your jump carefully though, since large boulders bounce higher than 
small boulders.
