   I'm going to assume you know about all the items, and where to get
   them.
   
   First you need to have the following: whip, key, ankh, money, money,
   and the crystal. The crystal is an item not mentioned in the
   instructions, that can RANDOMLY be found in the baskets where the
   flute and parachutes are sold. Just keep walking back and forth over
   the baskets until you get it. (May take five minutes, may take 10
   secs.)
   
   Now use the ankh by putting the cursor on it, and pushing your action
   button. This will transport you to the middle of the Mesa field. Work
   your way down to the bottom of it, by using the hook and grapple
   provided. If you miss a mesa top, simply push the button on your
   action joystick again, and you will be saved and put back to the
   middle mesa. Once you reach the bottom of the field, drop the ankh
   with the cursor joystick, and center yourself on this mesa. Walk down
   to the next board.
   
   This is the map room. Stay in the center strip, or you'll fall and
   die. Place the cursor on the key, and walk down the strip until the
   map lights up. Now VERY CAREFULLY walk to the right until you're in
   the center of this area, and put the joystick down. DO NOT TOUCH THIS
   ONE AGAIN. Place the cursor on the crystal, and wait for the sun to
   rise. You'll know it when you see it. Now Remember which mesa has the
   flashing dot on it. This is where the ark is to be found.
   
   Now place the cursor back on the key. You can walk out to the strip,
   but go down to the next board, and be ready for the robbers to be
   there. Proceed to the lower right corner, where you'll be magically
   transported to the black market. There are other ways to get here,
   this way is easiest with my solution to the game. Drop two money bags
   on the shiek with the shovel, and it's yours.
   
   Now to get back, walk to the center of the right hand side of the
   screen, and you should appear back at the regular market. If you
   appear at the robbers again, go back to the black market, and try a
   little higher up on the right hand side.
   
   Now you need to have: whip, ankh, parachute, and the shovel. Use the
   ankh to transport you to the mesa field, and proceed to the mesa where
   the ark is. Drop the ankh with the cursor joystick, and place the
   cursor on the parachute. Walk off the top of the mesa, and use your
   parachute, and move to the right to hook the parachute onto the
   branch. This is tricky, but practice makes perfect. Immediately after
   you land inside the mesa, DROP the parachute before the robber gets
   you. Walk to the bottom, where the dirt is, and place the cursor on
   the shovel. Dig. You must keep walking on and off the dirt in order to
   use the shovel. The ark is yours.

   Any additional secrets of the game would be greatly appreciated. My
   solution only gets the Ark, but I believe there are ways of getting a
   better score besides timing and number of lives used. For example,
   there is a second grenade at the black market, and I have experimented
   with it on the walls that form where the timepiece is kept (these
   walls only appear if you bump into a lot of the walls on the prison
   cell room). The hourglass does a similar affect to that of the Ankh,
   only if you miss a Mesa, you die. The timepiece is for timing the
   sunrise in the map room, and is not necessary. Neither is the gun or
   additional bullets if you become skilled with the whip. Enjoy the game
   and remember to mail me any tips or tricks you know of!
