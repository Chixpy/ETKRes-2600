AN ADULT VIDEO GAME CARTRIDGE for use with the ATARI 2600 VIDEO GAME SYSTEM and SEARS

<br>
<strong>INSERTING THE CARTRIDGE</strong><br>
&quot;X-Man&quot; is an adult videogame cartridge compatible with the ATARI 2600 video
Computer System and the Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade. To begin the game you must do the
following:<br>
<br>
1. Hook up the game console. Be sure the POWER switch is on the OFF position and the TV
TYPE switch in on COLOR position.<br>
2. Connect the JOYSTICK controller to the LEFT CONTROLLER connection at the back of the
game console.<br>
3. With the POWER switch on the OFF position, insert your Gamex Video Game Cartridge into
the game console in the same way you would insert any other compatible game cartridge.<br>
4. Turn the console POWER switch to the ON position.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>INTRODUCTION MODE</strong><br>
The first thing you will see is the INTRODUCTION MODE which introduces the game
characters. The first character is the&quot;Sexy Blonde&quot; who without clothes runs
from door right to door left. Right behind her in a state of arousal is our macho stud
&quot;X-Man&quot;. Next, and in hot pursuit of our hero are the attackers: the
&quot;Crab&quot;, followed by the &quot;Scissors&quot; and the &quot;Teeth&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>GAME PLAY</strong><br>
&quot;X-Man&quot; is a maze type video game. To actually begin game play you can either
push the button on your JOYSTICK or press the GAME RESET switch on the game console.
Immediately, the screen will change to the first maze which has an ORANGE DOOR in the
center. The count down timer on top will start counting down from 99 seconds.
Simultaneously, one of the attackers will come out of the ORANGE DOOR in search of
&quot;X-Man&quot;. &quot;X-Man&quot; starts at the bottom left corner of the maze. Three
additional &quot;X-Men&quot; are located at bottom left below the maze. These represent
your three additional &quot;lives&quot;. One life will be lost each time &quot;X-Man&quot;
is caught by one of his attackers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>OBJECT OF GAME</strong><br>
Using your JOYSTICK you control the left, right, up and down movement of
&quot;X-Man&quot;. Your object is to move him through the maze to the colored door in the
center within the 99 seconds allowed. You have four lives and risk losing one if you fail
to get to the door before the time runs out. Coming at you from the door are one of the
three attackers, (&quot;Crabs&quot;, &quot;Scissors&quot; or &quot;Teeth&quot;). You risk
losing one life each time you are caught by an attacker. When all four lives are lost, the
game is over.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>SCORING POINTS</strong><br>
Your score is based on how many seconds remain on the red COUNTDOWN TIMER at the top of
the screen when &quot;X-Man&quot; reaches the door in the center of the maze. Multiply the
number of seconds remaining on the timer times 10 to figure out your score (i.e. 45
seconds = 450 points). The faster you get to the door, the more points you score. You
score no points if you are caught by the &quot;Crab&quot;, &quot;Scissors&quot; or
&quot;Teeth&quot;. When there are 10 seconds remaining on the COUNTDOWN TIMER, the door
will FLASH and a warning SOUND will activate to remind you that you will lose one life and
score no points if you do not get to the door in the remaining 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>A SEXY SURPRISE</strong><br>
Once you reach the door, the maze will FLASH and the video screen will change format to
take you behind the door for a very SEXY SURPRISE. You have achieved your first goal and
now have 30 seconds to make love with the &quot;Sexy Blonde&quot;. Using your JOYSTICK,
you control the movement of &quot;X-Man&quot; as you try to bring the sensual excitement
to a climax. Move faster and faster and watch the action build. But don&#146;t let up your
pace or you may not reach climax in time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>BONUS POINTS</strong><br>
You can score additional bonus points during the SEXY SURPRISE MODE. At the bottom of the
screen you will see a letter &quot;L&quot; (which stands for Low) and a letter
&quot;H&quot; (which stands for High). This is your SEXUAL EXCITEMENT METER. As you move
the JOYSTICK back and forth in a constant and ever-increasing movement you will build the
sexual excitement of &quot;X-Man&quot; and the &quot;Sexy Blonde&quot;. For every
increment on the Low to High SEXUAL EXCITEMENT METER you reach, you will score an
additional 20 BONUS POINTS. You will see the color bar grow and hear a sound effect
increasing in pitch for each higher increment you achieve.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>ADDITIONAL BONUS POINTS</strong><br>
You have only 30 seconds as shown on the red COUNTDOWN TIMER at the bottom of the screen
to reach the H(High) mark on the SEXUAL EXCITEMENT METER and achieve a climax. You receive
additional BONUS POINTS based on the number of seconds remaining on the red COUNTDOWN
TIMER at the bottom of the screen when climax is reached. The additional BONUS POINTS will
be equal to 10 times the number of seconds remaining, (i.e. 10 seconds = 100 BONUS
POINTS). WARNING: If you do not reach climax as shown by the color bar reaching the
H(High) level on the SEXUAL EXCITEMENT METER within the 30 seconds allowed, you will lose
all points previously scored.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>BUILDING YOUR SCORE</strong><br>
During the first SEXY SURPRISE MODE your score achieved will be visible in blue at the top
of the screen. After climax is reached, the screen will reveal a new maze with a BROWN
DOOR in the center. Once &quot;X-Man&quot; reaches the BROWN DOOR, the screen FLASHES and
changes to take you behind the door to the second SEXY SURPRISE MODE. The SCORE achieved
will be visible in blue at the top of the screen.<br>
<br>
After climax is reached the screen will reveal a new maze with a BLUE DOOR in the center
of the screen. Once &quot;X-Man&quot; reaches the BLUE DOOR the screen FLASHES and changes
to take you behind the door to a third SEXY SURPRISE MODE. Your SCORE will be visible in
blue at the top of the screen.<br>
<br>
After climax is reached the screen will reveal a new maze with a GREEN DOOR in the center.
Once &quot;X-Man&quot; reaches the GREEN DOOR the screen FLASHES and reveals a 30 second
love-making experience which plays automatically. You can sit back and enjoy the bonus
visual because you&#146;ve earned it. You&#146;re one of the few game players able to
enjoy all the sensual surprises and bonus points that the &quot;X-Man&quot; video game can
offer. But don&#146;t feel too confident, because at the end of this 30 second mode, the
entire game cycle will repeat. This allows you to build on your score depending on your
skill as both a gamesman an lover until you have lost all four lives of &quot;X-Man&quot;.
When this happens the game is over and the screen will return to the first INTRODUCTION
MODE. Your final score will be visible at the top of the screen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>MULTIPLE MAZES AND RANDOM ACTION</strong><br>
There are multiple mazes which randomly appear throughout the game play in <br>
the &quot;X-Man&quot; video game. The attacking &quot;Crab&quot;, &quot;Scissors&quot; and
&quot;Teeth&quot; are also <br>
randomly chosen and follow a random pattern throughout the maze. &quot;X-Man&quot;, <br>
however, is totally your man and will respond to your every move throughout <br>
the maze action and during the love-play as well. To succeed in both phases <br>
of the game requires practice. So if you find it difficult at first, don&#146;t <br>
give up until you turn &quot;X-Man&quot; into the best of all possible lovers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>PAUSE MODE</strong><br>
Should you need to stop the game temporarily you can pause by merely moving the difficulty
switch on the game console to the &quot;B&quot; position. To continue the game, move the
difficulty switch back to the &quot;A&quot; position. PLEASE NOTE: Game will play on
difficulty &quot;A&quot; position only.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>RESET</strong><br>
To terminate any game and start anew, use the GAME RESET switch on the game console. The
button on the JOYSTICK can only be used to start a game when the game is in the
INTRODUCTION MOVE.<br>
