Atari 2600 Game Manual

Ikari Warriors

You are a member of those elite combat specialists, the Ikari
Warriors. Your buddy and you are on a special mission behind enemy
lines, and you've been sleeping, eating, and breathing jungle combat for the
last two weeks. Your tired, but that never affect your razor-sharp judgement
and your will to survive.

Your main weapons are machine guns, grenades, and your own
cunning in the face of danger. Sometimes you'll have a tank at your disposal,
which comes in handy when enemy fire is particularly brutal.

You move swiftly through the jungle, wading through rivers and
resting from time to time with the ruins of bombed-out buildings. You're
tunning out of ammunition and grenades but you know the battle can't last
forever. Sooner or later, one side is going to emerge victorious. Let's just hope
it's yours!

Getting Started

1. With your TV switched on, insert the Ikari Warriors cartridge into 
   your Atari 2600 (or 7800tm) as described in your owner's manual.

2. Connect a controller to the left controller port. In two-player 
   Ikari Warriors, connect a controller to each controller port.

3. If you are using an Atari 2600 use the TV TYPE switch to
   select color or black and white.

4. Switch on your console. The Ikari Warriors title screen
   appears.

5. To select one or two player Ikari Warriors, press SELECT or
   move the controller up and down to highlight the desired option. To
   select the highlighted option and begin the game, press the fire button
   or RESET.

6. To return to the opening screen and restart the game with
   the currently selected options, press RESET.

JUNGLE WARFARE

Playing the Game

Ikari Warriors is a one or two player game of survival. You
and your partner move behind enemy lines in the hopes of wiping out the enemy.
You begin the game with 50 grenades, 99 rounds of ammunition, and 3 lives.
If your luck you can capture a tank to protect you from enemy fire.

Move your controller to manoeuvre through the jungle. Your main weapons are
machine guns and grenades. To fire bullets and tank shells, press the fire
button. To toss grenades, hold down the fire button for one or two seconds
until the grenade launches.

Watch you bullet and grenade supply carefully. Pick up new supplies before you
run out. To pick up new supplies, simply walk over a supply icon. There are no
icons that up-grade your fire power. (See items.)

The tank, which moves only on dry land, provides safety from enemy bullets. To
enter the tank, move your player onto the top of the tank.

The tank can be destroyed by enemy grenades. If the tank sustains damages
while you are inside you go with it. To exit the tank, hold down the fire
button for one or two seconds. Press the fire button to fire shots from the
tank.

You must pick up fuel along the way to keep the tank moving.
The tank explodes if it runs out of gas, so don't miss the energy
supply icons!

In your journey through the jungle you will occasionally encounter a river or
the sea. You will have to cross the water in order to continue. You can still
fire while you are in the water. 

If you come into physical contact with an enemy soldier you
lose a life. You can hide behind rock and rubble to avoid enemy gunfire.
However you will still be vulnerable to their grenades, so watch out!

Each time the enemy makes a successful hit you lose a life.
You receive a bonus life every 10,00 points. The fame is over when you lose
your last life. To win the game, you must rescue the colonel being held
captive by the enemy.
