XONOX DOUBLE-ENDER
			GHOST MANOR
			for Atari 2600 VCS and Sears Video Arcade
			GAME INSTRUCTIONS
You (either a girl or boy, your choice) stand in a lonely graveyard outside
Ghost Manor.  A  friend is trapped inside.  You must find a way to enter the
Manor and rescue the prisoner through 5 game screens.  But beware!
Unfriendly ghosts lurk behind tombstones; witches and goblins haunt the
entryway; and demons and ghastly spirits may attack at any moment.  It's
very dark.  Only brief flashes of lightning aid your search for the magical
coffin.  Remember...finding your friend is only half the game.  You must
then find a safe way out.  Good luck!

GAME LAYOUT:
There are FIVE play screens in the game:

1. GRAVEYARD - screen 1
At beginning of the game tombstones rise from the dead.  You play tag with
the friendly RAINBOW GHOST or BONES the SKELETON to collect spears to shoot
in the next screen.

2. THE GATE IN FRONT OF GHOST MANOR CASTLE - screen 2
Many flying spooks guard the castle entrance, and their leader, the evil
CHOPPING MUMMY tries to stop you.  Shoot the spooks by hurling your spears
at them.  Kill the mummy after the guards are eliminated.

3. 1st FLOOR INSIDE THE CASTLE - screen 3
Lightning flashes in the night -- your only visible guide unless you have
the lamp lighted.  A maze of corridors and rooms with caskets awaits you.
Touch the casket just right to find an extra cross and treasure points.
BEWARE touching the stationary walls -- they are electrified and can stun
you.  Watch out for the moving wall -- it can crush you to death.  Stairs
lead to the next room.

4. 2nd FLOOR INSIDE THE CASTLE - screen 4
More elaborate mazes with more caskets.  Collect treasure points and another
cross from the caskets, but watch your time -- and the moving wall!  Stairs
lead to the next floor.

5. PRISON ATOP THE CASTLE - screen 5
Here is the prison holding your friend, and the sinister guard DRACULA!  You
must imprison DRACULA to free your friend by using the crosses to repel
DRACULA.  BEWARE he follows your every move!  Rescue your friend and get to
safety down the stairs -- before time runs out!

6. CONCLUSION -- back to the graveyard.
As dawn breaks you will be returned to the graveyard.  If victorious a merry
melody plays and you rejoice with your friend.  If you lost, both of you are
doomed to descend into the ground with the tombstones!
