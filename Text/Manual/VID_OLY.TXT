VIDEO OLYMPICS

by ATARI
c 1977


Use your Standard Paddle Controllers with this ATARI(R) Game
Program(TM).  Be sure the Controller cable is firmly plugged into the
jack at the rear of your ATARI Video Computer System(TM).  For one and
two player games, plug the Paddle Controllers into the LEFT CONTROLLER
jack.  For three and four player games, you  will need an additional
set of Paddle Controllers.

Note: Always turn the console power switch OFF when inserting or
removing an ATARI Game Program.  This will protect the electronic
components and prolong the life of your ATARI Vide Computer System.



CONTROLLER ACTION
-----------------

Turn the knob to move the paddles.  Press the red Controller button to
speed hit, WHAMMY(TM), CATCH(TM) the ball or jump the paddle depending
on the game you play.  Some games give you a particular game feature to
use in competition.  Activate these game features with the red
Controller button:

Speed - When you want to add some speed to the return ball, press the
red Controller button as the ball makes contact with your paddle.

WHAMMY(TM) - Put sharper angles on your return hits.  Press the red
Controller button as the ball makes contact with the paddle.  The angle
will continue on your return hit as long as you press the red
Controller button or until your opponent returns the hit.

CATCH(TM) - Press the red Controller button as the ball hits the paddle
and the ball sticks to the paddle.  Use this time to plan strategy, aim
a hit or pass to a team paddle.  But move slowly and carefully.  The
ball will fly off the paddle if you make fast or sudden movements.

Jump - Make the paddle jump up to hit or spike the ball during certain
games.  Just press the red Controller button and your paddle will jump
from the bottom of the playfield to the playfield center.  Be sure to
activate the jump before the ball passes through the playfield center
or the ball will travel through the paddle instead of bouncing off the
paddle.

NOTE: To see what game features each game offers, check the game matrix
at the conclusion of each game description.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------



DIFFICULTY
----------

Slide the Difficulty switch from "B" to "A" position and your paddle is
reduced to half size.



PONG(R)
-------

Pong(R) is played much like tennis.  Using a Controller, each player
rallys the ball by moving the paddles on the playfield.

Paddles move only vertically on the playfield.  When one player
controls more than one paddle, all the paddles move together in unison. 
If there are two players on one team, the second player's paddle will
be striped.  Each team's paddles are color coordinated with the scores
at the top of the playfield.  The right hand score refers to the right
Controller player or team; the left number shows the left Controller
player or team score.

A player or team scores one point when the opponent hits the ball out
of bounds or misses a hit.  The first player or team to score 21 points
wins the game.

The last player or team to score always serves the ball.  Serve by
pressing the red Controller button after waiting at least one second
after the point is made.  If there are two players on one team, either
player can serve.  In Robot Pong, the computer always serves the ball
to the player...who lost the point.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: In two-player games, plug your standard paddle Controllers into
the left side of the Console.  Each player will have a solid paddle on
the playfield.

SOCCER
------

Get ready to kick that ball into the goal.  Each player uses a hand-
held Controller to move the kickers on the playfield.  When you turn
the Controller knob, your kickers move together in unison.

A player or team scores one point when the ball is kicked into the
goal.  The first player or team to score 21 points wins the game.

Each team's soccer kickers are color coordinated with the score at the
top of the playfield.  The right hand score refers to the right
Controller team or player; the left score shows the left Controller
player or team score.  If there are two players on one team, the second
player's kicker will be striped.

The last team to score puts the ball into play.  Put the ball into play
by pressing the red Controller button after waiting at least one second
after the point is made.  If there are two players on one team, either
player can put the ball into play.

QUADRAPONG
----------

The king of Pong games! Four players play this Pong game.  Two players
are on each team, and each player controls one paddle.

Team paddles are color coordinated with the score at the top of the
playfield.  The right hand score refers to the right Controller player;
the left score shows the left Controller player's score.

The movement of each player's paddle is restricted to one side of the
rectangle playfield.  Each side of the rectangle has a goal.  Each
paddle guards a goal.

To score one point, a player must hit the ball into either goal guarded
by the opposing players.  (Be careful not to score against your
teammate!)  The first team to score 21 points wins the game.

The last team to score serves the ball by pressing the red Controller
button after waiting at least one second after the last point is made. 
Either player can serve on a two-player team.


Quadrapong(R)
(Four-Player Game)

Each player controls his paddle with a Controller and attempts to make
goals.  The first team to make 21 goals wins the game.

HANDBALL
--------

Play Handball just as you would a regular game of handball.  Two or
four players each control one Paddle.  Paddles are located on the same
side of the playfield and are color coordinated with the score at the
top of the playfield.  The right hand scores refer to the right
Controller player or team; the left number shows the left Controller
player or team score.

When your paddle is solid, it is your turn to hit the ball.  After you
successfully hit the ball, your paddle will start to blink.  If you hit
the ball out of turn (when your paddle is blinking), your opponent
scores one point.  You score one point when your opponent misses the
ball or hits it out of turn.  The first player to reach 21 points wins
the game.

moves in a horizontal line across one half of the bottom playfield. 
Each player or team has a basket.  The player on the left side of the
playfield must shoot the balls at the basket on the right side of the
playfield.  The right side player shoots at the left basket.

Paddles are color coordinated with the score at the top of the

A player or team scores one point when the ball goes through the
basket.  The first player to score 21 points wins the game.

pressing the red Controller button after waiting at least one second
after the last point is made.  Either player on a two-player team can
put the ball into play.

Where you dribble the ball on your paddle determines the direction the
ball will travel.  For example, dribble the ball off the right side of
your paddle and the ball will shoot to the right.

NOTE: Be careful not to shoot the ball into your opponent's basket on
your side of the court.

And of course, this game was made by Atari in 1977.  This very very very 
long game manual was typed in by me!  Who am I?  I am Eddie Beiles.  I 
can be reached at beiles@lambada.oit.unc.edu if you have any questions 
about this game manual, like why I put the game matrix in there twice 
(because that is the way it was in the manual).  Or you can email me and 
thank me for typing it in (please do, this one took *forever*).  Anyway, 
enjoy the game and this wonderfully typed in manual.       4/10/95
