Take several rows of suspended &quot;three-dimen-<br>
sional&quot; qubes. Drop onto them some very weird<br>
creatures in pursuit of a guy who loves to hop, and<br>
what have you got?<br>
<br>
One of the whackiest games you may ever play!<br>
And a most challenging one. You may need to<br>
match two or even three rows of qubes in one<br>
round. And then there is always someone -- or some<br>
thing -- trying to stop you... not to mention undo<br>
what you've already done. It's great fun, too. When<br>
was the last time you met a Meltnik or a Shoobop?<br>
<br>
Q*bert's Qubes... It's a video game and another<br>
dimension.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Object</b><br>
<br>
To color-match qubes in a row (or rows) of four. Do<br>
so in order to move to the next round. There are four<br>
rounds per level, ten levels in all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Setting the Console Controls</b><br>
<br>
1. Place the cartridge firmly into the cartridge slot.<br>
<br>
2. Since this is a one-player game, plug a joystick<br>
controller firmly into the LEFT controller jack.<br>
<br>
3. Choose a skill level. To start at Level 1 (easy), set<br>
the LEFT Difficulty switch at A. To start at Level 6<br>
(difficult), set the switch at B.<br>
<br>
4. Set the TV Type switch to COLOR -- even if you're<br>
playing on a black and white TV.<br>
<br>
5. Turn the power ON.<br>
<br>
6. Press the GAME RESET switch to begin.<br>
<br>
At any time during the game, you may start<br>
over by pressing the GAME RESET switch.<br>
<br>
If you wish to freeze the action, set the TV TYPE<br>
switch to B-W.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Joystick Controller</b><br>
<br>
Hold the joystick controller so that the four corners<br>
form a diamond with the fire button at the top.<br>
Move the joystick in the direction of the arrows --<br>
and only in these directions -- in order to make <br>
Q*bert hop diagonally up and down the rows of<br>
qubes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Playing</b><br>
<br>
In this game Q*bert has six lives. Remaining Q*berts<br>
are shown at the top of the screen.<br>
<br>
<b>Matching the target qube</b><br>
Look at the qube in the upper left portion of the<br>
screen. This is the target qube. The object is to<br>
color-match a row (or rows) of four qubes to this<br>
target qube. To make a match, Q*bert must jump<br>
off the qube in the appropriate direction -- as if he<br>
were tumbling that qube. (This may have to be<br>
done several times.) Once the qube matches the<br>
target qube, it becomes one color. In lower levels, a<br>
matched qube is locked in place. As you'll see in<br>
higher levels, matched qubes can become unmatched<br>
by Shoobops -- or by Q*bert himself!<br>
<br>
Once Q*bert matches the required number of rows<br>
to win the round, he is rewarded with a fanfare of<br>
lights and sounds and proceeds to the next round<br>
with his remaining lives.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Meltniks</b><br>
Meltniks derive their name from an uncanny ability<br>
to sink and disappear into qubes that match the<br>
color of their complexions. Although a Meltnik may<br>
look harmless, he or she can put an end to Q*bert if<br>
he runs into one. (Warning: Although Q*bert can<br>
stop other greeen characters, he can't stop a green<br>
Meltnik!)<br>
<br>
<b>Purple Ball</b><br>
Q*bert mustn't ever play catch with Purple Ball<br>
because Purple Ball will squash him on contact!<br>
Also, be warned that when Purple Ball reaches the<br>
bottom qubes, it hatches Rat-a-tat-tat!<br>
<br>
<b>Rat-a-tat-tat</b><br>
A dirty rat if ever there was one. This rat follows<br>
Q*bert like Monday follows Sunday and will finish<br>
Q*bert off if Q*bert's not quick. There is, however, a<br>
trick to getting rid of the rodent. You see, Rat-a-tat-<br>
tat has a terrible sense of balance. When he jumps<br>
onto a qube that's changing colors, he loses his<br>
balance and falls. Change the colors at just the<br>
right moment, and Rat-a-tat-tat is off Q*bert's trail!<br>
<br>
<b>Sheldon the turtle</b><br>
Sheldon is an influential turtle. When Sheldon and<br>
Q*bert collide, everyone (except Q*bert) slows<br>
down a bit and new characters are introduced at a<br>
slower rate.<br>
<br>
<b>Green Ball</b><br>
Green Ball poses no danger for Q*bert when the<br>
two collide. In fact, there is good reason for doing<br>
so: When Q*bert and Green Ball collide, all charac-<br>
ters except Q*bert freeze for a moment. During this<br>
time, Q*bertmay hop about freely until the action<br>
resumes.<br>
<br>
<b>Shoobops</b><br>
Some Shoobops wear shades while others do not.<br>
In the long run they're all the same. They're green<br>
and they're mean! Green because Q*bert can<br>
make them disappear on contact and mean be-<br>
cause they can change the colors of qubes -- even<br>
ones that have already matched the target! So...<br>
see a Shoobop... shoo it away!<br>
<br>
<b>Bonus Round</b><br>
Upon completion of every fourth round, Q*bert<br>
plays the Bonus Round. During this round, Q*bert<br>
stands in place and rotates a qube beneath him.<br>
Once it matches the target qube, Q*bert jumps to<br>
the next qube. The object is to match as many<br>
qubes as he can for bonus points before the round<br>
ends.<br>
<br>
<b>End of Round</b><br>
The round ends when you match the required<br>
number of rows. The following round will display a<br>
new target qube.<br>
<br>
<b>End of Game</b><br>
The game ends when you lose your last Q*bert. To<br>
play again, press the GAME RESET switch.<br>
<br>
<b>Game Escalation</b><br>
The longer you stay in the game, the more chal-<br>
lenging it becomes:<br>
The characters in pursuit move at a faster rate.<br>
The characters in pursuit are introduced more<br>
frequently.<br>
You may be required to match up to four rows<br>
per round.<br>
Fewer free qubes are given per round.<br>
Qubes may NOT lock in place once they are<br>
matched.<br>
<br>
