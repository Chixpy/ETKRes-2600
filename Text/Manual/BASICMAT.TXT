Basic Math

Use your Joystick Controller with this game program. Be sure to 
plug the Controller cable firmly into the left jack on the rear 
of your Video Computer System. See your Owner's Manual for details.

NOTE: To prolong the life of your Atari Video Computer System and 
protect the electronic components, the Console unit should be OFF 
when inserting or removing a game program.

Controller Action
Use the Joystick to make numbers appear on the Blackboard Screen. 
Push the Joystick forward to cycle through numbers from 0-9. 
Push it towards you to make the numbers appear in decreasing order from 9-0. 
Use the Joystick Controller to also move the Answer Line. 
Move the Joystick to the right and left to move the Answer Line to 
the right or left.
The red Controller button records your numbers with the Computer Teacher. 
Press the button after you have selected answers to the math problem 
and after you choose problem numbers.

DIFFICULTY

RIGHT DIFFICULTY SWITCH 
Use this switch to determine if each round (math problem) will be timed. 
In "A" position the player has a time limit to produce an answer. 
In "B" position, there is no time limit.

LEFT DIFFICULTY SWITCH 
Use the switch to determine the time limit for each round (math problem).
Games 1-4: With the Difficulty Switch in the "A" position, 
you have 12 seconds to record the answer. 
In "B" position, you have 24 seconds.
Games 5-8: In "A" position, two digit problems appear with
a 24 second time limit. One digit problems with a 12 second 
time limit appear when the switch is in "B" position. 
(Remember to slide the Right Difficulty Switch to "A" position 
first for a timed game.)

SCORING
Each game presents 10 math problems. You score one point for each 
correct answer. At the end of each game two numbers flash on the 
screen: the number of total problems, 10, is in the right hand side, 
and your score is on the left side.

TABLE PROBLEMS
Each game features a particular type of math problem. After you select 
the game you want to play, a problem will appear on the Blackboard Screen.

An example addition problem is:

The top number, 7, will be underlined. Push the Joystick 
forward until you find the number you want to work with. 
For example, need some practice on additions using number 8? 
Just follow these two steps:

1. Press the Joystick forward once until number 8 appears as 
   the underlined top number.
2. Then record your number 8 with the Computer Teacher by pressing 
   the red Controller button.

NOTE: You will find that sometimes there will be less than 
10 problems with the top number you have selected. When this occurs, 
the game automatically selects problems from the next number group.

HOW TO RECORD AN ANSWER
Use your Joystick to show your answer on the screen. Push
it forward to cycle through the consecutive numbers 0-9. Push 
it towards you to cycle through the numbers in decreasing order, 9-0. 
For example, if no number is showing, you can put number 2 on the 
Blackboard Screen by: 
- Pushing the Joystick three times - one time for each of the 
   numbers O, 1 and 2 
OR 
- Pressing the Joystick forward as the game cycles to number 3. 
  Then release the Joystick.

After you've selected the kind of problem and number you want to 
work with, notice the Answer Line below the math ~ problem on the 
Blackboard Screen.

The line equals space for one digit of your answer. You will find that 
you can move the Answer Line to the right and left with your Joystick 
Controller. Just move the Joystick to the right or left.
If your answer is more than one digit, you will  have to move
the Answer Line. For example, in the above problem, the answer is 15. 
To record your answer:
- Select the number 5 with your Joystick. It will appear above the 
  present Answer Line. The last digit of your answer must always appear 
  on this line. 
- Move the Answer Line one digit to the left. 
- Select the Number 1 with the Joystick. The Number 1 will appear 
  above the Answer Line.
- Now press the red Controller button to record your answer, 15.

Some division problems will have a Remainder. To show the Remainder, 
move the Answer Line two digits to the right of the Quotient. 
Select the Remainder number with the Joystick. Now record your 
entire answer by pressing the red Controller button.

RIGHT OR WRONG?
Musical tunes announce whether your answer is right or wrong.

- Correct answers receive a "BEEP" then a melodic tune. 
  The Computer Teacher automatically presents the next problem.
- Wrong answers receive a "BEEP" and a melodic tune. But the wrong 
  answer disappears as the right answer flashes on the Blackboard 
  Screen. The Computer Teacher automatically presents the next problem.

The game is completed after 10 problems. At the conclusion of the last 
problem, the total number of problems, 10, and the number correct answers 
flashes on the Blackboard Screen.

GAME 1- Addition 
Select the top number you want to work with, then start adding.

GAME 2 - Subtraction 
Select the top number you want to work with, then start subtracting.

GAME 3 - Multiplication 
Select the top number you want to work with, then start multiplying.

GAME 4 - Division 
Select the top number you want to work with, then start dividing.

RANDOM PROBLEMS
Follow the same rules and procedures to tackle Random Problems as 
you did to solve Table Problems. Random Problems feature addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division. The only difference between 
these games and Games 1 through 4 is the absence of a top number 
selection. You have no control over the numbers in these problems.
For example, after you select a subtraction game, the game presents 
subtraction problems at random. You begin your answer immediately.

GAME 5 - Addition 
The game automatically presents addition problems at random.

GAME 6 - Subtraction 
Get ready for surprise subtraction problems.

GAME 7 - Multiplication 
Practice your times tables with this game of multiplication.

GAME 8 - Division 
Division problems are selected at random for you to solve.
