<p>QUADRUN - An Atari original! Long ago, the peaceful land of Quad was invaded by cruel
Captors who rounded up all the helpless inhabitants and imprisoned them in cages. The
Captors called their prisoners &quot;Runts&quot;. And the name has stuck. Now you've come
to Quad to rescue the Runts and destroy their Captors with your special weapon: phaser
balls. </p>

<p>Insert the Quadrun cartridge as explained in your Atari 2600(TM) Video Computer
System(TM) owner's guide, and turn on your console. Plug a joystick controller into the
LEFT CONTROLLER jack. Press the red fire button to begin the game. During a game, press
the red fire button to shoot phaser balls. Press GAME RESET during a game to start the
game over. </p>

<p>* Your weapon: phaser balls Shoot the Captors with a phaser ball, then run to the
opposite sector and catch the phaser ball so that you can reuse it. Be quick and accurate:
you have only three phaser balls with which to destroy the Captors. The game ends when you
lose all three phaser balls. <br>
* Running around the quad The Quad consists of four sectors, with a Runt cage in the
center. You can run to any sector on the screen. But to switch from a vertical sector to a
horizontal sector, or vice versa, you must touch one of the side walls. <br>
*The bad guys: the captors There are five Captors per wave. Each wave begins with the
QUADRUN voice, and each wave features a different type of Captor. Captors patrol the quad
vertically. You can shoot at Captors only while you're in the vertical sectors. If a
Captor crashes into you, you lose a phaser ball. <br>
* The good guys: the Runts Runts escape from the center cage and race madly left or right
toward their doom: an electrified toaster grid. Catch each Runt before it runs into the
grid or it will fry. You can cath Runts only while you're in the horizontal sectors. <br>
* Don't let the critter counter disappear! The white line located at the top of the screen
is the Critter Counter. Every time you fail to destroy a Captor or fail to catch a Runt,
the Critter Counter decreases in length. When it disappears, the game ends. <br>
* Crazy Crazed Wave After you complete five waves, you begin the CRAZED WAVE. At the start
of the CRAZED WAVE, the Critter Counter returns to its full length and you receive bonus
points for all remaining phaser balls. During the CRAZED WAVE, you face constant attacks
from a random assortment of the five types of Captors. </p>

<p>HINTS <br>
- When a Brat Captor attacks, run to the opposite side of the screen and &quot;lead it
on&quot; in order to destroy it. <br>
- When a Yo-Yo rushes out, go to the spot where it first appeared and wait for it to
return - like a yo-yo, it always comes back to where it started. Then hit it with your
phaser ball. <br>
- If you're not in a horizontal sector when a Runt escapes from its cage, hit the closest
wall in order to move quickly into the horizontal channel and catch the Runt. <br>
- If you have only one phaser ball left and a Captor is about to crash into you, fire the
phaser ball (then go catch it!) so that you won't automatically lose it. </p>
