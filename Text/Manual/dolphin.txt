DOLPHIN DECODER

DOLPHIN BASICS
--------------

Listen!  An endangered dolphin is calling you!  Only by learning the =
dolphin's
sonic language can you guide her through schools of seahorses, battling =
a=20
monstrous squid, to gain magic powers from and elusive seagull.  Hurry!  =

1.  Hook up your video game system.  Follow manufacturer's instructions.

2.  With power OFF, plug in the game cartridge.

3.  Turn power ON.  If no picture appears, check connection of your game =
system
    to TV, then repeat steps 1-3.

4.  Plug in Joystick Controller/s (solo player uses left Joystick).

5.  Difficulty Switches.  Set both difficulty switches to b to begin.  =
With
    the switches in this position, your dolphin will have 4 seconds to =
touch
    the squid after intercepting a seagull.  In position a, she'll have =
only 2
    seconds to do so (see "Seagull" under "How to Decode").

[Note to owners of Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade.  Difficulty is called =
skill:
a is expert and b is novice]

6.  Game variations.  There are eight game variations.  Games 1, 3, 5, =
and 7
    are for one player.  Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are for two players.  =
Level of
    difficulty rises accordingly, with games 1 and 2 being the easiest.  =
At
    higher levels, the squid will be smarter and quicker.

7.  To start, press game reset switch.  The action will begin as soon as =
you
    press the red button.

8.  The Joystick Controller is held with the red button in the upper =
left=20
    position.  Push your Joystick forward, and your dolphin will rise.  =
Pull
    your Joystick back, and your dolphin will dive.  Push the Joystick =
left or
    right and your dolphin will swim in that direction.

9.  Bonus Dolphins.  You start the game with one active dolphin and a =
school of
    four on reserve.  For every 20,000 points you score, a bonus dolphin =
will
    be added to your reserves.


HOW TO DECODE DOLPHIN BY ACTIVISION
-----------------------------------
You will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by
listening to sonic tones and catching waves (see "Cues" and "Currents" =
under
"Special Features").  Pay attention to the following:

^  The Seagull.  Periodically, a seagull will fly overhead.  You'll know =
he's=20
   coming when the squid changes color.  Have your dolphin leap up, =
touch the=20
   seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid.  This is the best =
way to=20
   gain points.  Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level =
putting
   distance between your dolphin and the squid.

^  The Slip.  Another great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him =
"the=20
   slip".  If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a =
good=20
   wave.  Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him
   immediately.  As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, =
he=20
   won't be able to reverse and catch you.

^  Scoring.  Points are earned in a variety of ways.  Every time your =
dolphin
   touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points.  The number of =
points
   depends on the color of the squid (see "Increasing Difficulty" under
   "Special Features").  Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per =
squid.

   Also, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good =
wave or
   each time you run the squid into a bad wave.  And, when your dolphin =
swims
   through the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your =
degree
   of accuracy in getting her through the opening.


SPECIAL FEATURES OF DOLPHIN BY ACTIVISION
-----------------------------------------
Sonic Cues.  The dolphins are communicating with you!  The higher the =
tone,=20
the higher up the opening will be in the upcoming school of seahorses.  =
A lower
tone means that the next opening will be lower on your screen.  Let your =
ears
guide you!  Each time your dolphin doesn't swim perfectly through the =
opening,
she will be slowed down.

Ocean Currents.  Catch a good wave!  'Good' waves are arrows moving in =
the
same direction as your dolphin.  They'll increase her speed.  'Bad' =
waves are
the arrows moving head-on into your Dolphin.  They'll slow her down.  =
Avoid
hitting bad waves, but try to lead the squid into them to increase your
dolphin's lead.

Increasing Difficulty.  The longer you play, the tougher the chase =
becomes. =20
Each time the squid changes color, he's getting smarter, tracking your
dolphin's every move with greater speed and accuracy.  So, it gets much =
tougher
to give him "the slip".  Meanwhile, the Seagull flies by faster and bad =
waves
more so quickly you'll think you're swimming upstream.=20



GETTING THE FEEL OF DOLPHIN BY ACTIVISION
-----------------------------------------
As you'll learn, the ocean is full of unique sights and sounds.  At =
first, just
keep listening to the dolphin's sonic tones to learn which opening =
matches each
tone.  Also, practive catching good waves and leading the squid into bad =
waves.
Don't get frustrated!  With practice, you can really develop these =
necessary
skills.

Since dolphins don't fly, you can't hold them in the air when a seagull =
flies
by.  So get used to timing her leaps our of the ocean with the speed and =

position of the seagull.  And remember, the squid changes color just =
before the
seagull appears.

Then, there is that handful of you who will reach the ultimate.  A =
certain very
high score (the amount is secret, but it is under 500,000) will cause =
the score
to be replaced by a secret word.  This is the requirement for initiation =

Just send us a photograph of your TV screen, with your name and address =

Tips from Matthew Hubbard, designer of Dolphin.

     Matthew Hubbard is full of surprises.  Besides designing top-notch
     video games, he's a member of a new wave band!  Matt also knows a
     lot about dolphins, and we're pleased to introduce them in his =
first
     work on behalf of Activision.

"The best tip I can give you is this: 'He who hesitates is lunch.'  But, =
for=20
the record, here are a few more pointers.

"At first, don't completely rely on the 'slip'.  Instead, become an =
expert at
decoding sonar.  Work with one tone at a time until you can easily =
predict the
exact location of each opening.  Notice, too, that there is never an =
opening
at the very bottom or very top of the schools.

"Another thing to notice is that a bad wave often follows each opening.  =
So,
after your Dolphin swims through, be ready to make a quick move.

"Dolphins are truly amazing, and I hope my work will inspire you to find =
out
more about these great mammals.  If you read any interesting facts, or =
would
like to discuss the game, send me a note.  I look forward to hearing =
from you."
