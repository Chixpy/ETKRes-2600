For the Atari (r) 2600 (tm)

"jump on that board and get psyched for a totally intense cruise!..."

----

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To Begin

1) With power off, insert the Skateboardin (tm) cartridge into your Atari 
   2600 (tm) game system according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2) Plug joystick into port labeled "left controller".

3) Turn power on.

4) Press RESET to begin the game. (At any point during the game, press 
   RESET to begin again.)

The Cruise
~~~~~~~~~~

You _know_ you're late for school, but what you _don't_ know is that just 
overnight, an array of obstacles has been placed along the way.  _Radical 
man_, this is a skateboarder's dream come true!  You have to get to 
school on time, but passing up the chance to ride ramps or cruise tubes 
would make you look like a real nerd!  You've got to conquer a total of 
thirty tubes and ramps in under five minutes to be totally awesome.  Not 
only that, after you find all the tubes and ramps you have to find the 
front steps of the school building.  Check the ratings at the end of the 
instructions to find out how radical you are.

Your time clock is displayed at the top left of the screen, and next to 
the clock is a number representing the amount of tubes and ramps you have 
remaining.  Other obstacles include walls, rails and hurdles, _but you 
need only conquer the tubes and ramps to finish._  The others, however, 
must be avoided as they will stop you and knock you off your board.

You start at the steps of your house, holding your skateboard.  Press 
RESET to begin.  You can walk by moving the joystick in the direction you 
want to go, but that's not going to get you to school very fast.  
Instead, point the joystick left or right, and press the button to jump 
onto your board.  Once on your board, _press the button to jump or press 
it and hold it down to crouch._  If the button is held down, you will 
land into a crouch after the jump.

As you set your course through this gnarly maze, keep in mind that the 
scoreboard display is _not_ a wall.  If you choose to go up, you can 
cruise right on through.  You can cruise through the walks or over the 
turf area, but cutting across the turf will slow you down.  To regain 
your speed, you must either stay on the turf long enough to stop, or run 
into an obstacle.  This will bring you off your board so you can jump 
back on and resume at normal speed.

To ride a ramp, you can be in either standing or crouched position - just 
make sure you are cruising within the area from the botton to the top of 
the ramp.  In other words, don't try to hit the ramp below or above it or 
it won't count.  A _bing_ sound will indicate a successful ramp jump.

To clear a tube, you must travel through it while in a crouch.  Head in 
the direction of the tube, align yourself with the opening and then 
crouch by jumping and keeping the button down.  While in a crouch, if you 
need to adjust your position, _tap_ the joystick up or down to fine tune.  
If you are approaching the tube while standing, or if you miss the 
opening, you will crash into it and stop.  A _bong_ sound will indicate a 
successful pass.

Tips from the Pros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember, each obstacle must be conquered only once.  Try to improve upon 
your time by checking out new shortcuts.  

If you want to max out your speed, get yourself up to the street (at the 
very top of the maze) and try to catch the truck when it passes the stop 
sign.  If you miss it, get off of your board and position yourself with 
just your feet on the sidewalk.  When it passes, it will pick you up and 
take you for a ride down the street.  Get off by moving the joystick in 
the direction you want to go, but watch out - now you're really _cruising_!

You know you're close to the school when you find the schoolyard.  If you 
get really stuck in the maze, try making a map.

There are rumors of a truly radical skateboarder who finished all thirty 
obstacles and got to school with more than 2 minutes left.  See if you 
can top that!
