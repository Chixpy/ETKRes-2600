The dice puzzle has 16 squares of random numbers between 1-6. The object is to change all
the numbers to 6 in the shortest amount of time, using the fewest numbers of turns.<br>
<br>
When the power is turned on, each square will have the number 1. After pushing the reset
button, all the dice change to random numbers. (The game is guaranteed to be solvable
every time.) There is a small square that moves outside of the left side and over the top
by using the joystick. When the fire button is pushed, all the numbers in the row next to
the square increase by one. The numbers can also be changed diagonally. Every 5 minutes a
warning will sound, up to a maximum time limit of 60 minutes. When all the dice are
changed to 6, the game will automatically end displaying time used and number of turns
taken.<br>
<br>
The dice puzzle - sometimes mind boggling, sometimes a cinch, is always loads of fun. Come
and match wits with the computer.</font></p>
