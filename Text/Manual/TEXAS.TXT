HOW TO PLAY THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE VIDEO GAME

The player controls Leatherface and his whirring chainsaw.  Computer-controlled
victims flee in terror as you pursue them.  Beware of the obstacles in your
way - cow skulls, fences, wheelchairs, and thickets.  At the top of the screen
is the number of fuel tanks left, and a gauge indicating the amount of gas
left in the chainsaw.  At the bottom of the screen is the score display.

Using your joystick, move Leatherface in the desired direction and try to
overtake your victim.  When you're close enough, press the joystick button once
to rev up the chainsaw and eliminate your quarry.  Caution: The chainsaw is
always idling, using only small amounts of gas.  Revving the motor quickly
drains your fuel.  Therefore, be sure you are in range before you press the
button.  Leatherface starts the game with three tanks of gas, so conserve your
fuel.

BONUS: Extra fuel is awarded every 5,000 points.

Watch out for obstacles that hinder you from getting to your prey.  Cow skulls,
fences, wheelchairs and thickets appear at random in your path.  If you run
into an obstacle, Leatherface is momentarily delayed, allowing victims to
escape.  Hint: You will find that the thickets give way to the bite of your
chainsaw.  But keep an eye on that fuel gauge!  The game is over when your
last tank of gas runs out, and one of the survivors returns to kick Leatherface
in the pants!
