Gopher
  Gopher is a one or two player, full color game
designed to be played on the Atari Video Computer
System or the Sears Video Arcade.
  Gophers have launched a merciless assault on your
carrot patch. Grab your shovel and fill those holes
before they tunnel out and eat your choice carrots.
With no time to run back to the barn for more seeds
to plant, it's a good thing that crazy duck keeps flying
by dropping them. But it's awfully tricky to catch a seed,
plant it, and still keep those persistent Gophers away.
Just when you think everything's under control, they
get faster and hungrier! Take a deep breath, and let
the battle begin.
 
Set-Up Instructions:
1. Connect the Atari Video Computer System or
   Sears Video Arcade following the manufacturer's
   instructions.
2. Install left joystick control for single player, or both
   for two player game.
3. Insert the cartridge making certain that the power
   is OFF.
4. Move the POWER switch to ON.
5. Select the game of your choice.
6. Press the red fire button on the joystick to start
   the game.
7. Push the RESET button anytime to start a new game.
8. After the game is over, a new game may be started
   by pressing the fire button on the joystick.
9. LEFT DIFFICULTY SWITCH - Player 1
      Position A - Very Smart Gopher
      Position B - Smart Gopher
   RIGHT DIFFICULTY SWITCH - Player 2

Controls:
- Use left joystick for single player, both joysticks for

  the farmer above hole and depressing the fire button.

Game 2 - Two player with duck.
Game 3 - Single player; no seed planting.
Game 4 - Two player; no seed planting. 
 
Scoring:
Each Gopher bonked            = 100 points
Each section of tunnel filled =  20 points
 
Playing Hints:
- Stay somewhat centered in the carrot patch, and
  slightly move back and forth with movement of the
  Gopher - but don't follow him. He can move much
  quicker than you and also will appear on one side 
  and then the other. Move out cautiously but quickly,
  and fill the nearest hole that is up to the surface -
  maybe only partially because you have to get back
  to protecting your carrots.
 
- Bonking: This very strategic and satisfying game-
  play technique could be the answer to that multidigit
  score! You can Bonk the Gopher on the head as he
  emerges from his hole or anywhere above ground
  as he runs for a carrot. This is the most rewarding
  accomplishment as you receive 100 points for bonk-
  ing and can manage enough time for a chuckle
  before your next bonk! Timing and accurate position-
  ing is the key to bonking.
 
- Planting: This can be tricky but the best approach is
  - stay cool! Don't panic when the seed is dropped.
  Keep one eye on the Gopher; and, meanwhile, posi-
  tion the farmer approximately under the falling seed.
  Then, make your last fine tuned adjustments by tap-
  ping the joystick the appropriate direction to catch
  the seed.
 
- IMPORTANT: If only one carrot remains and you 
  have a choice between bonking and planting, by all
  means BONK; if you lose that last carrot, it's back to
  shoveling out the barn.
 
  By the way, it is possible to catch a seed, bonk a
  Gopher, and then plant the seed. If you manage to
  do this, you can probably also pat your head and rub
  your tummy while hanging by your knees. Anyway -
  HAPPY BONKING!!
