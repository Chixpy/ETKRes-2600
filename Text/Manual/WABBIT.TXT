                      APOLLO GAME INSTRUCTIONS
                          8 Game Variations
                       For One Or Two Players


THE SITUATION

You are a farmer, named Billie Sue, trying to protect your crops.  
One patch in particular is giving you trouble.  It's surrounded by 
ten holes from which wabbits [sic] dart into your field.  Scare off 
the pesky creatures by throwing wotten [sic] eggs at them (they're in 
abundance this year and worth much less than good country carrots).  
The score on the left depicts the number of carrots the wabbits have 
snatched and deposited in their wabbit holes.  The current carrot 
count increases every time a wabbit gets back into his hole with one 
of your carrots.  Your score increases everytime you wallop a wabbit 
with a wotten egg.  It's an egg-citing experience.

THE SET-UP

WABBIT (TM) is played by one or two players using the Joystick 
Controller.  Be sure the power is off when you insert or remove the 
WABBIT (TM) cartridge from your video game system.

THE DIFFICULTY SWITCH

The difficulty switch controls how fast Billie Sue moves.  In the 
easier "B" mode, she dashes about nearly as fast as the bunnies 
[sic].  Nut in the more challenging "A" mode, Billie Sue is getting 
tired, and you'll need greater skill in throwing wotten eggs to make 
up for her slowed pace.

THE GAME SELECT SWITCH

Each time you depress this switch, you will select a new game 
variation.  The numbers of different variations described in the game 
menu in this manual will appear on the game screen, with the number 
of players who may participate in that game variation shown at the 
right.  In the two player game, players alternate every time the 
wabbit gets 25 carrots.  Games seven and eight are children's games, 
designed for easy play for the very young.

THE RESET SWITCH

When this switch is depressed, the game will begin.  The variation 
select number on the left of the screen and the number on the right 
will both change to "0" [zero], and will become scoreboards.  The 
right hand figure will now be Billie Sue's score, and the left hand 
figure [will be] the wabbits' current carrot count.  When the game is 
over, you may press the fire button or reset switch to re-start the 
game.

THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLER (with a picture of a standard Atari joystick)

Hold your Joystick Controller so that the "FIRE" button is in the 
upper left corner.  Moving the joystick to the left or right will 
cause Billie Sue to run in that direction.  Pressing the red "FIRE" 
button will cause her to throw a wotten egg at a wabbit.

GENERAL PLAY

Wabbits will exit from their burrows in a wandom [sic] manner, trying 
to steal your carrots and race back to their holes.  They will forget 
about carrots and run back home when hit by a wotten egg thrown by 
Billie Sue.

(picture of the actual game on TV;  Billie Sue is at the bottom of 
the screen facing the field, which is in the middle, and the burrows, 
on each side of the field.)

SCORING

When wabbits carrying carrots successfully return to their burrows 
without being hit by wotten eggs, the current carrot indicator on the 
left of the screen will increase by one point.  Every time Billie Sue 
is able to hit a wabbit with a wotten egg before the wabbit reaches a 
carrot, you will receive five points.  When the wabbit is hit by a 
wotten egg on the way back from its burrow with a carrot, you will 
receive ten points on your score on the right of the screen.  And you 
get a bonus: every 100 points you get will cause the wabbits to lose 
25 carrots from their current carrot count.  The game will end when 
the wabbits' score reaches 100 points.
