<p><font size="4" face="Courier New"><strong>POLARIS</strong></font><font size="2"
face="Courier New"><br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">A one or two player game for <br>
the Atari Video Computer System<br>
or Sears Tele-Games<br>
using joystick controllers </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
You're the commander of a Polaris class nuclear submarine. Your mission is to defend your
country from enemy attack. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">War has been declared and you find yourself deep in
enemy water with no help. In your battle, you will be required to defend against wave
after wave of enemy planes and dive bombers. To make things worse, the enemy has sent
their own subs and destroyers. in the course of your battles, you will need to maneuver
through dangerous channels full of mines. Don't expect a short war and the battles get
rougher, how many of the enemy can you destroy before they get you. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>INSTRUCTIONS </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Use your Joystick Controllers with this
TIGERVISION(tm) game cartridge. For a one player game, use the left joystick only. Hold
the joystick with the red button to your upper left. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>NOTE</strong> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Make sure the console unit is turned off when
removing or plugging in the game cartridge. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>GAME SELECTION </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Turn the console unit on. The number of players is
below the world PLAYER. To select 1 or 2 players use the game select switch. When a two
player game is selected, players will alternate turns. The player currently playing is
indicated by the number just under his score (1 or 2). The number of subs remaining is
also indicated on the same line. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>SKILL SELECTION </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The two Difficulty or Player Skill switches are not
used in this game. Difficulty levels are discussed in the game level section. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Also, the color/B-W switch is not used. The colors
used in the game were selected for good contrast when viewed on a B/W TV. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>STARTING THE GAME</strong> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">When you are ready to play, press the Game Reset
switch. Your submarine will be placed in the left side of the ocean, and the enemy planes
and subs will attack. Move fast to avoid the subs and bombs. If you want to restart a game
in progress, press the Reset switch once and the game will return to the title screen.
Press the Reset switch again and a new game will begin. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>JOYSTICK CONTROLLER ACTION </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The Polaris sub can be moved four ways: up, down,
left and right. The red button fires the Polaris missiles in the first screen and fires
torpedoes in the second screen. In the first screen, a missile can only be fired after the
previous missile has left the screen or hit an object. In the second screen pressing the
red button will cancel the bullet in progress and fire again. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>GAME ACTION AND SCORING </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">ENEMY OBJECTS: There are five enemy objects and each
has a different point value as described below. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">BOMBER SQUADRON: There are up to five bombers in two
squadrons that will fly across the screen and drop bombs on your submarine. Point value
varies by altitude; top plane 300 points, middle two planes 200 points each and bottom two
planes 100 points each. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">ENEMY SUBMARINES: You should be very careful since
the enemy captains are poor at maneuvering and may ram and sink your sub as they patrol
across the ocean. They can be found alone or in groups up to three large. Point value
varies by depth; top sub = 100 points, middle = 200 points, bottom = 300 points. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">ENEMY DESTROYER: Occasionally a destroyer will find
his way into the battle and drop depth charges on your. Since he appears only
occasionally, he is worth 800 points. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">DIVE BOMBER: If you successfully fight off the enemy
squadrons, they will send a diver bomber in with torpedoes that will seek you out. These
torpedoes are smart but can be avoided if you're fast. Hitting the dive bomber will be
tough since it is flown by an expert pilot and can maneuver rapidly. This is a big kill,
worth 1000 points. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">CHANNEL MINES: When navigating the channels you will
find mines to block your way. Careful, the current and the seas get rougher as you
proceed, each mine is worth 300 points. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
<strong>GAME LEVELS </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">You will begin with a squadron attack and have
submarines and occasionally a destroyer in the battle. When all the squadron planes are
destroyed an enemy torpedo bomber will appear. If you successfully kill him you will
proceed to the next level via the mined channel. Note mines will not appear until level 2
to give you a chance to understand the channel's terrain. Each level has more enemy
objects or is faster as described in the table below. </font></p>
