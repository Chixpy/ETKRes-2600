ATARI GAME PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS

1. GOING BONKERS WITH BERZERK

The Astro Date is 3200 and you are the last survivor of a small group of
earth people who came to explore the planet Mazeon. Soon after landing, you
discovered the planet is a dark, apparently uninhabitable place. But by
then it was too late to turn back because your space craft had been
destroyed by Automazeons.

Now you are a prisoner here. You are trapped in a maze where even the walls
are death to touch. Grim robot thugs known as "Automazeons" stalk you
relentlessly and you must systematically pulverize them with your laser gun
before they eliminate you with theirs.

You are never safe on the planet Mazeon. Even when you've destroyed the
mechanical heavies, Evil Otto, the mad and merciless mind behind the robot
gangs, leaps out from where he's been observing the battle. You flee in
panic because you know that you cannot kill Evil Otto and that, once he
catches you, you'll never escape.

He will pound you to a lifeless pulp, grinning like a maniac all the while.
Your only hope is to get out of the electrified maze before Evil Otto
catches you.

If you do get out, you find yourself in another maze. Again the faceless
robots shoot at you, again Evil Otto pursues you, again you must dodge and
shoot and run ... into yet another maze. It's enough to drive you bonkers!

2. GAME PLAY

NOTE: BERZERK is for one player only.

Your challenge in BERZERK is to score as many points as possible without
being destroyed yourself. In some game variations, you must elude the
robots' expert aims and escape Evil Otto. (See Section 5 for a description
of GAME VARIATIONS.)

Use your Joystick Controller to maneuver your man through the maze (but
don't touch the walls or a robot, you'll electrocute him!). Press the red
controller (fire) button to shoot your laser gun at the robots. You score
points for every robot that is destroyed. You score bonus points when all
robots in a maze are destroyed - whether they are struck by your laser,
pummelled by Evil Otto, hit by other robot lasers, they collide with each
other, or run into the electrified wall. Each maze ends when your man
perishes or escapes. Figure 1 shows an example of what you may meet in a
typical BERZERK maze.

In games where the robots shoot they never start firing until the second
maze. This gives you a chance to become familiar with the game. Initially,
robots move and shoot slower than your man. But with each consecutive maze,
up to the 16th maze, the robots' movements and firing speeds gradually
increase. At maze 16, the robots reset to move slowly again (gradually
increasing speed with each maze) but their firing speeds remain equal to
your man's until the game ends.

You begin the game with three lives. Lives that remain will flash briefly
at the bottom of the screen, off-centered to the right, just before a new
maze appears. Figure 2 shows you what remaining lives look like. You will
lose a life if you: 1) are hit by a robot's laser, 2) run into the
electrified wall of the maze, 3) get caught by Evil Otto. In certain game
variations, you can earn extra lives. Again, check Section 5 - GAME
VARIATIONS, to learn about these variations. When all your lives are lost
the game is over.

3. USING THE CONTROLLERS

Use your Joystick Controller with this ATARI Game Program cartridge. Be
sure to plug the controller cables firmly into the jacks at the back of
your Video Computer System game. Hold the controller with the red fire
button to your upper left toward the television screen. Use the LEFT
CONTROLLER jack for this one-player game. See Section 3 of your owner's
manual for further details.

Use the Joystick Controller to:

   * Begin or restart a game.
   * Move the man through the maze on the screen.
   * Aim and shoot your man's lasers.

Press the controller button to start a new game. You can do this whenever
the game is over.

Push the Joystick forward to move the man up and pull it back to move the
man down the screen. To move the man left, push the Joystick to the left.
Push the Joystick to the right to move the man right.

You can also make him move and shoot diagonally by moving the Joystick
diagonally forward or back (See Figure 3.)

Press the red button to fire your laser. It will shoot in the direction you
have most recently moved your man. Also, if you depress the fire button
while moving the Joystick, your man will stand and fire lasers in any
direction you move the Joystick.

5. GAME VARIATIONS

BERZERK includes 12 exciting game variations. Before describing each of
these games, we would like to acquaint you with game play terminology.

BONUS LIFE
In addition to the three lives you start the game with, extra lives can be
won in certain game variations. For example, in Game 1 you receive one new
life every time you score 1,000 points. The computer congratulates you with
a little tune each time you win another life. A maximum of six lives can be
displayed on the screen at one time, although you may have more lives in
reserve. The number of lives you can win in these game variations is 255.
After that the counter resets to zero and you must start winning bonus
lives all over again.

INVINCIBLE EVIL OTTO
When Evil Otto is invincible, he keeps coming at you. There is no deterring
him. You can only escape him by running out of the maze.

REBOUND EVIL OTTO
Some games feature a reboud Evil Otto, in which you can actually shoot the
grinning head with your laser and he will disappear for a few seconds.
Beware! Evil Otto will soon reappear to continue in pursuit of you. Zap him
again and he will disappear again. You can make him rebound an infinite
number of times.

NON-SHOOTING ROBOTS
In some game variations, the robots aren't armed. You can stand right in
front of them but they can't shoot you. Take care, you will still lose a
life if you touch one.

GAME 1
In Game 1 you receive an extra life every 1,000 points, there is no Evil
Otto to pursue you, but watch out for the robots - they'll be shooting at
you!

GAME 2
Game 2 offers a bonus life every time you make 1,000 points, the robots
fire at you and Evil Otto rebounds when you shoot him.

GAME 3
You win a new life every 1,000 points in Game 3. You'll need all the lives
you can get because in this game Evil Otto is invincible and the robots
stalk you with their lasers.

GAME 4
In Game 4 you have the opportunity to gain a new life every 2,000 points,
there is no Evil Otto, but the robots are militant and you must dodge their
deadly laser beams.

GAME 5
With a rebound Evil Otto and mean robots on the prowl, Game 5 is like Game
2 - except a bonus life is won at 2,000 points rather than 1,000.

GAME 6
Win another life every 2,000 points in Game 6. But watch out for invicible
Evil Otto and combatant robot goons.

GAME 7
In Game 7 there are no bonus lives and no Evil Otto. You have only the
laser-firing robots to contend with.

GAME 8
Game 8 offers a rebound Evil Otto. Otherwise it is exactly like Game 7.

GAME 9
For a real BERZERK challenge, try Game 9! Here, Evil Otto is invincible,
the robot gangs are armed and dangerous, and you have no bonus lives to
prolong game play.

GAME 10
In Game 10 you have the opportunity to win a new life every 1,000 points,
the robots don't shoot, but watch out for Evil Otto - he's invincible!

GAME 11
You can really rack up the points in Game 11. The robots don't shoot, Evil
Otto rebounds and you get a new life every 1,000 points.

GAME 12/CHILDREN'S VERSION
This is the easiest of all BERSERK variations. In Game 12 there is no Evil
Otto, the robots don't shoot at you, and you win a bonus life every 1,000
points. It's a good game for beginners or young children.

6. SCORING

Your score is determined by the number of robots that are destroyed.
Whether you shoot a robot or it is eliminated by other means, you receive
points for every pulverized robot. You will earn bonus points when all the
robots in a single maze are annihilated. Occasionally you will meet a super
strong robot who is merely stunned by your first shot. Be brave, it will
take a second hit to destroy this tough enemy.

Once you begin to score points, your score will appear at the bottom of the
screen, off-centered to the right, as shown in Figure 5. When all robots in
a maze are destroyed, your score disappears and your bonus points flash on
the screen, off-centered on the left, as shown in Figure 6. The computer
automatically combines all points and your total score is displayed in the
next maze. You can score a maximum of 999,999 points before the score rolls
back to zero.

Remember, in game variations where the robots shoot back, they never
commence firing until the second maze. This will enable you to learn the
maze. But, beginning with the second maze, you will no doubt find it more
challenging to survive and continue scoring high points. Points are scored
as follows:

7. STRATEGY AND HELPFUL HINTS

When you first start playing the tougher BERZERK variations (games in which
the robots shoot and Evil Otto is invincible), you may feel there's no way
to survive. Don't despair! The following are some strategies you can use to
stay alive longer, score more points, and even escape the dread Evil Otto.

   * Since the robots' shots cannot penetrate the maze walls, use this to
     your advantage. Hide behind walls to dodge laser fire, then leap out
     when it is safe to aim and shoot at robots.

   * Position robot(s) between your man and Evil Otto. This strategy should
     cause Evil Otto to destroy the robot(s) first (thereby scoring points
     for you) and you will have more time to escape.

   * Evil Otto moves more slowly when there are robots on the screen. But
     once all the robots are gone, the evil fellow bounds toward you with
     amazing speed! Remember this so you can position your man near an exit
     as you finish off the robots, then make a swift escape.

   * Keep your finger on the fire button as you move from one maze to
     another. It takes the robots a few seconds to start their attack and
     you can often blindly zap them when you enter shooting.

   * Since robots are programmed to follow you, you can influence them by
     your movement, causing them to shoot at and collide with each other or
     run into walls.

   * Evil Otto always enters where the man enters. Try to get away from
     this danger zone and near an exit as soon as it is safe.

   * Keep your distance from robot gangs because you can cover yourself in
     only one direction at a time. When you find yourself surrounded by a
     gang, shoot your way out and put some space between you and them. It's
     much easier to see and avoid distant robot fire than close range fire.

   * When robots shoot on the vertical it is from the left side. You can
     position your man above or below them on the right side where they
     can't hit you, but you can blast them.

   * Unlike you robots cannot shoot on the diagonal. If you stand
     diagonally to one you will be out of its line of fire while it will be
     vilnerable to your laser shot (See Figure 3.)

   * There is a special horizontal laser beam wraparound feature that will
     help you destroy robots. In mazes that have a right and left exit, you
     can stand just inside the right exit and shoot through it. Your laser
     beams will then "wrap around" the screen (as shown in Figure 7) and
     reenter on the left side through that opening. Any robots standing in
     your line of fire will be struck.
