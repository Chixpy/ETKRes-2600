BLAST OFF
Civilizaion is doomed...unless you can save the Cosmic Kids.  You must 
get your Orbinaut from the planet up to the space station.  Then rescue 
the kids before the planet's orbit decays completely.

But watch out!  Villainous Space Skeeters and Cosmic Creeps are 
constantly on the attack.

To succeed, you'll need every ounce of skill and stamina you possess.  
And succeed you must.  The fate of all Kid kind is in your hands.

OBJECT OF THE GAME
Save the Cosmic Kids from certain destruction and score as many points as 
possible before the planet falls out of orbit.  When it disappears from 
the screen your time is up.

{Page 2}

GETTING READY TO PLAY
Use the Joystick Controller.  Always be sure the power is off before 
inserting or removing the Cosmic Creeps cartridge from your video game 
system.  Use the controller plugged into the LEFT CONTROLLER jack.  Hold 
the controller so the red button is to your upper left.

DIFFICULTY SWITCH
Has no effect on this game.

TO BEGIN PLAY
Press game reset.  Push red button on Joystick Controller for subsequent 
games.

HOW THE GAME PROGRESSES
Cosmic Creeps is played in two parts.

The Voyage

First get an Orbinaut from the planet to the flashing white portals of 
the space station at the top of the screen.  If he collides with red 
plasma or a Space Skeeter on his way, he barrels off into space.  You 
then must release another Orbinaout which drops the planet one notch and 
hastens its demise.

Push the Joystick forward to realease your first Orbinaout.  He heads 
straight out from the planet, so time his release carefully.  Use the 
Joystick to move him up, down, right and left; avoiding plasma and 
Skeeters.  (Notice that the planet is falling lower and lower as play 
progresses.  It will fall a total of 12 notches before it disappears 
completely.)

When your Orbinaut enters the space station and disappears from the 
screen, you gain control of the space station and the second part of the 
game begins.

The Rescue

>From the lower left corner of the screen, the first of your Cosmic Kids 
begins his escape to the space station.  Close on his heels are Creeps 
who will send your Kid back if they catch him.  Your job: bop the Creeps 
back to the planet, allowing your Kids to reach the upper right corner of 
the screen and escape.  But be careful not to bop your Kids.  (In bold) 
DON'T LET A CREEP THROUGH EITHER OR THE GAME'S OVER!

To release a bopper, push the red button on the Joystick.  Moving the 
Joystick left to right will move the Space Station.  After one Kid 
reaches safety (or gets bopped, heaven forbid!) you may release another 
Kid by pushing forward on the Joystick.  Every time you release a Kid the 
planet falls another notch.

You can never have more than one Kid and two Creeps on the screen at the 
same time.

If the planet sinks off the screen before you reach 5,000 points  the 
screen flashes and the game is over.  If you score over 5,000, you 
progress to a new planet, a new Orbinaut and a faster-paced voyage and 
rescue.

SCORING
You earn 1,500 points for each Kid who escapes safely.  You earn 100 
points for every Creep you bop.

A SAFE VOYAGE
Good luck.  You, your Orbinaut and the Cosmic Kids are all going to need it!
