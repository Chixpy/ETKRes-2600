 MILLIPEDE  Blast Those Bugs 		Video Game Cart for the ATARI 2600 VCS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RID YOUR GARDEN OF THOSE BOTHERSOME BUGS!
	An army of menacing millipedes - cousins to the famed Centipede - have
	invaded your garden patch, and you must shoot arrows at them to rid
	your plot of these pesky pests.  But wait!  The millipedes aren't the
	only insidious insects you have to destroy.  Jumping spiders, buzzing 
	bees, bouncing beetles, mosquitoes, dragonflies, inchworms, and earwigs
	all have unique and deadly powers of their own!

GETTING STARTED
	Insert the MILLIPEDE cartridge as explained in your 2600 Video Computer
	System owner's guide, and turn on your system.

	Plug a joystick controller into the LEFT CONTROLLER jack for this
	one-player game.

	Press GAME SELECT or the fire button to select the number of points you
	want to begin a game with.  In the first game of any game playing
	session, you can start with 0, 15,000, or 30,000 points.  Move your
	controller forward to increase your score and back to decrease your 
	score.  After the first game, you can start at up to 15,000 points
	below your previous high score (in 15,000 point increments up to
	300,000).  If you just played a game and scored 107,000 points, for
	example, you can start your next game at 90,000.

SURVIVAL TIPS
	* Make sure you keep your eye on the millipede while you're getting rid
	of the other pests.  The millipede can sneak up on you if you're not
	careful, so keep it under control.

	* If a millipede touches a poisonous mushroom - poinsonous mushrooms
	are colored differently from most - watch out!  The millipede will
	charge directly at you!

	* When the insects swarm, you're in for big trouble if you're not
	alert.  Only a spider can enter the garden while the mosquitoes, bees,
	or dragonflies are swarming.  You get 100 extra points (above the
	normal point value) for the second swarming bug you destroy, 200 for
	the third, and so forth - up to 1000 extra points per bug.  But beware! 
	Swarming bugs fly fast and furious!

	* Each insect has its own unique sound, so keep your ears open and you
	can anticipate what will be coming next.

SCORING
	You begin the game with three lives.  For every 15,000 points you earn,
	you're awarded another life.

	*Mushroom 		1
	Mushrooms are all right, but they're slowly choking you out of your
	garden.

	*Millipede head 	100
	*Millipede segment 	10
	The millipedes attack from the top of your garden.  They march back and
	forth across your patch until they get to the bottom.  When a millipede
	bumps into a mushroom, it reverses direction.  If any part of the
	millipede touches you, you're finished!

	*Spider 		300, 600, 900, or 1200
	Jumping spiders enter from either side of the screen.  How many points
	you get for ridding the garden of a spider depends on how close it is
	when you shoot it.

	*Beetles		300
	Beetles crawl in when you least expect them.  They also have a
	paricular pattern they follow, so pay attention!

	*Mosquito 		400
	Swat mosquitoes for big points.  But you'd better be quick with your
	arrows - mosquitoes also swarm!

	*Bees 			200
	Bees buzz randomly through the magic patch.  They have a very distinct
	sound, so they're easy to recognize.  But watch out when they swarm at
	you or you're sure to get stung!

	*Inchworm 		100
	The inchworm can't move too quickly, but is tricky just the same.  When
	you shoot this little critter, the movement of all the insects on the
	screen is slowed down for about four seconds.

	*DDT Bomb 		800
	Thank goodness for pesticides!  Just pierce one of the DDT bombs in
	your garden and earn an automatic 800 points.  Expode the DDT at the
	right time, and the vapor will wipe out any bug it touches!  For each
	bug that's destroyed by DDT, you'll earn triple the points you'd 
	normally get for it.

	*Dragonfly 		500
	Be careful!  These flying beasts like to swarm too.

	*Earwig 		1000
	Earwigs are hard to hit, but if you're on target, they're worth a lot. 
	Earwigs also poison mushrooms on contact, changing their color if you
	don't get them before they cross the width of the screen.  Get the
	earwigs before they cause more damage.

	Each time you lose a bug blaster, you receive 5 points for every flower
	and every three mushrooms left on the screen.
