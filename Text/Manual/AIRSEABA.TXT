AIR-SEA BATTLE





NOTE: Use your Joystick Controllers with this Game Program. Be sure the 
Controllers are firmly connected to your Console unit. If, after inserting this
Game Program into your Video Computer System and turning it on, no playfield 
appears on your television scree, turn the Console unit OFF, wait ten seconds, 
and then turn it ON again.





CONTROLLER ACTION





Controller action varies depending on the game being played. Details for 
Joystick Controller action can be found under each game heading. In all cases, 
hold the controller with the red button to your upper left towards the 
television screen.





SCORING





All games end after 2 minutes, 16 seconds of play, or when either player scores
99 points. During the last 16 seconds, the score will flash to show that the 
game is nearing the end.  Point scoring for each game is noted in that game's
instruction.





DIFFICULTY

The Difficulty switches on your Atari Video Computer System console control the
size of the missile. In Position "A" the missile is one-fourth the size 
of position "B".

Gun Position





Your Joystick Controller changes the angle of your "Anti-Aircraft Gun" and also
the angle of the missile flight in Guided Missile Games. Forward = 30 degree; 
center or rest = 60 degrees; back = 90 degrees (straight up).





In the Anti-Aircraft games, from one to six flying objects will move together 
across the playfield in a set. All objects in the set must be hit before a new 
set will appear. Each object scores one point.





GAME 1

This is the Anti-Aircraft game described above. Your missile travels at the same
angle your "Anti-Aircraft gun" was in at the time you fire.





GAME 2

In this game, you and your opponent have "guided" missiles. After firing, you 
control the angle of flight of your missile by moving your Joystick Controller 
from front to back.





GAME 3

The left "gun" is fired continuously by the computer. Using the right Joystick 
Controller, try to out score the computer.

NO POINTS






This set of Anti-Aircraft games adds a challenge to your
marksmanship. There are various flying objects on the
playfield travelling at different speeds and directions. Each
object has a different score value; Small Jet = 4 points;
Large Jet = 3 points; Helicopter = 2 points; 747 = 1 points.
The "Observation Blimps" flying randomly across the bottom of
the playfield score no points, and act as an obstruction to
your line of fire.





GAME 4

In this game your missile travels at the same angle as your
"gun" was in at the time you fired.





GAME 5

Using "guided" missiles try to outscore your opponent. After
firing, you control the angle of flight of your missile by
moving your Joystick Controller from front to back.





GAME 6

Here's another chance to beat the computer. The right Joystick
Controller is your "gun", while the computer fires the left
"gun" continuously.

you move your submarine to the left. Moving it to the right
moves your submarine to the right.





You control half the playfield, your opponent controls the
other half. From one to six ships move across the playfield in
a set. When one set disappears from the playfield, a new set
appears. Each ship scores one point.





GAME 7

After firing, your torpedo travels straight up from where it
was fired.





GAME 8

In this game, you can "guide" your torpedo after firing. By
pushing your Joystick Controller to the left, you guide your
torpedo to the left. Moving the Joystick to the right guides
the torpedo to the right.





GAME 9

With non-guided torpedoes try to sink more ships that the
computer. You control the right submarine, the computer will
fire continuously from the left.

NO POINTS



In this group of Torpedo games, mines travel randomly across
the bottom of the playfield, and act as obstructions to your
line of fire. The ships move at different speed and
directions. Each ship has a different point value: PT Boat = 4
points; Aircraft Carrier = 3 points; Pirate Ship = 2 points;
Freighter = 1 point. Hitting the mines will score no points.





GAME 10

As in Game 7, your torpedo travels straight up from where it
was fired.





GAME 11

In this game, you can "guide" your torpedo after firing. By
pushing your Joystick Controller to the left, you guide your
torpedo to the left. Moving the Joystick to the right guides
the torpedo to the right.

Your Joystick Controller changes the angle of fire; forward =
30 degrees; centre or rest = 60 degrees; back = 90 degrees
(straight up). In addition you can move your "gun" across your
half of the playfield by moving your Joystick Controller left
or right.





The targets will change direction at any time and all targets
in a "set" must be hit before new targets are displayed. Each
target has a different point score: rabbit = 3 points; duck =
2 points; clown = 1 point.





GAME 13

This is the Shooting Gallery Game described above. After
firing, your Joystick Controller has no effect on the line of
fire.





GAME 14

After firing, guide your "projectile" into the targets by
moving your Joystick Controller forward or backwards (see
diagram above). Moving the Joystick right or left has no
effect on the "projectile" once it is fired.





GAME 15

You control the right "gun" and try to beat the computer
controlled "gun" which fires continuously.





             FAST                 In the following games

You captain a ship travelling across the bottom of the
playfield. The bottom most ship is the right player. The ships
will change direction occasionally.





Front one to four planes fly over in a "set". All planes in a
set must be hit before new planes are displayed. Each plane
has a different point value: Small Jet = 4 points; Large Jet =
3 points; Helicopter = 2 points; 747 = 1 point.





GAME 16

This is the Polaris game described above. Your missile travels
at the same speed as your ship when the missile was fired.
After firing, your ship speed cannot change while the missile
is in flight.





GAME 17

In this game, when you change the speed of your ship, you also
change the speed of you missile while it is in flight. So, you
can guide your missile into the planes.





GAME 18

Using the right Joystick Controller, you control the bottom
ship. With non-guided missiles, try to beat the computer-
controlled top ship. The computer ship will move at a steady
speed and fire its missiles continuously.

You are the pilot of a plane flying across the top of the
playfield. The right player controls the bottom-most plane.
Planes will occasionally change direction from right to left.





From one to four ships will pass under the planes. As a ship
is hit, a new ship will replace it from the edge of the
playfield. Ships travel at various speed and each a different
point value: PT Boat = 4 points; Aircraft Carrier = 3 points;
Pirate Ship = 2 points; Freighter = 1 point.





GAME 19

As your bomber drops the bomb, it will move across the
playfield at the same speed as your plane at the time it was
dropped. After firing, your plane cannot change speed while
the bomb is dropping.





GAME 20

Changing the speed of your plane after dropping a bomb will
change the speed the bomb travels across the playfield as it
drops. This allows you to guide your bomb into the passing
ships.





GAME 21

Using non-guided bombs try to hit more ships than the
computer. The computer plane is on top and flies at a constant
speed across the playfield, dropping bombs continuously. You
control the bottom plane with the right Joystick Controller.





POLARIS vs BOMBER GAMES





The left player flies the plane across the top of the
playfield and the right player controls the ship at the bottom
of the playfield. The plane drops bombs on the ship while the
ship shoots missiles at the plane. One point is scored for
each hit. The ship or plane getting hit will disappear from
the playfield and reappear at the edge. Both plane and ship
will change direction occasionally.





GAME 22

This is the Polaris vs Bomber game described above.





GAME 23

Both the ship and the plane can guide their missiles or bombs.
By changing the speed of your ship or plane after firing, your
missile or bomb will change speed as it travels across the
playfield.





GAME 24

The computer controls the plane and will fly at a constant
speed across the playfield, dropping bombs continuously. The
right Joystick Controller controls the ship.





POLARIS vs BOMBER GAMES





Travelling randomly across the middle of the playfield are
mines. In order to hit your opponent, you have to get around
the mines which act as obstructions to your line of fire. The
mines score no points when hit.





GAME 25

This version plays the same as Game 22, except that mines are
added to the playfield.





GAME 26

By changing the speed of your ship or plane after firing, your
missile or bomb will change speed as it travels across the
playfield, allowing you to guide them around the mine and into
your opponent.





GAME 27

Once again, the computer controls the plane, and with the
right Joystick Controller, you control the ship.
