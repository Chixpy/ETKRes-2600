<p>INSTRUCTIONS</b></p>

<p>(For 1 Player)</p>

<p>The object of the game is to blast enemy aircraft out of the sky... and dodge ground
missiles!!! Zero in on enemy planes! Bank left, bank right, dive, climb out! Watch your
elevation! Keep track of the fuel! Run out of ammo... land and refuel... take off again!!!</p>
<b>

<p>THE GAME</b></p>

<p>It's a dogfight... you against your enemy! You're the pilot, gunner and navigator all
in one!!! Enemy planes are buzzing you. Anti-aircraft ground forces are shelling you!</p>

<p>Get an enemy plane in your sight and FIRE! Try to shoot down as many as you can! If
ground fire (flak) explodes in your sight... you're hit... you quickly lose altitude.
Climb back up! Stay clear of the flak!</p>

<p>You must shoot down at least 10 planes before you can land to refuel then take off
again! The game ends when you run out of ammo completly or when you crash! Press RESET and
start again. Try to get a better score each time. Challenge a friend!</p>
<b>

<p>THE CONTROLS</b></p>

<p>Use the left joystick controller for this game. Be sure the controller cable is
securely plugged into the back of your game console. Hold the controller so the RED BUTTON
is to your upper left.</p>
<b>

<p>LET'S START THE ACTION!</b></p>

<p>CHOOSE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY:</p>

<p>Before the game begins, set your LEFT Difficulty Swith to &quot;A&quot; or
&quot;B&quot;. It's much harder to get away from the enemy shelling in the &quot;A&quot;
position.</p>

<p>TAKE OFF:</p>

<p>When you start a game, and after you refuel, press the RED BUTTON. The runway light
appear to move as your plane starts to move. When you gain speed (about 4 seconds), pull
back on the JOYSTICK for takeoff. If you try to take off before gaining enough speed, you
will crash! Wait too long before takeoff and you will run out of runway. You'll quickly
get the hang of the timing!</p>

<p>Once you are airborne, keep clear of enemy flak and be on the alert for enemy planes!!!</p>

<p>FLY THE PLANE:</p>

<p>Fly the plane by pushing the JOYSTICK. You can make the plane fly in four different
directions. You can quickly change the direction the plane is flying. If you don't move
the joystick, you level off and fly straight ahead.</p>

<p>Push joystick down to make the plane climb.</p>

<p>Push joystick left to make the plane bank left.</p>

<p>Push joystick up to make the plane dive.</p>

<p>Push joystick right to make the plane bank right.</p>

<p>Your point of view is through the cockpit window. As you &quot;turn&quot; the plane,
your view changes.</p>

<p>Turn left &amp; dive: See more ground</p>

<p>Turn right &amp; dive: See more ground</p>

<p>Turn left &amp; climb: See more sky</p>

<p>Turn right &amp; climb: See more sky</p>

<p>AIM &amp; FIRE</p>

<p>You're on a gunnery mission! To fire, get the enemy into your sights, then press the
RED BUTTON. Make a direct hit and the enemy plane blows up!</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Don't stop shooting until you are really low on fuel! It's important to make
as many hits as you can when airborne!</p>

<p>WATCH THE GAUGES:</p>

<p>It's important to keep an eye on your gauges. You can fly to a maximum 40 altitude
(This is 40,000 feet). There aren't many enemy planes at this altitude. Be careful when
you dive. You lose altitude fast! Get down under 10 and you'd better climb out before you
crash!</p>

<p>Once you are airborn you begin using fuel. Climbing uses about 4 times as much as
diving, and about twice as much as flying level.</p>

<p>When you get really low on fuel, it's time to land and refuel! Time this carefully or
you might run out of fuel und crash!</p>

<p>Watch your plane position indicator. Fly into the red zone and you're into heavy flak.
This zone is ecen more dangerous at the low altitudes. Keep out of this zone as much as
possible.</p>

<p>LAND... REFUEL... TAKE OFF AGAIN:</p>

<p>You can land at any time. BUT you can only refuel and take off again if you made at
least 10 hits the last time up! Wait until you are really low on fuel then fly down to 00
altitude. Wait for the runway to appear, approximately 4 seconds. Push foreward on the
JOYSTICK until the horizon in all the way up, then release the JOYSTICK. You've landed!</p>

<p>Once you land to refuel, you lose some ammo. Check your ammo gauge. You only have as
much ammo as the number of hits you made the last time up. For example, if you got 11 hits
then landed, you will take off with 11 amma after refueling. If you are a crack shot, you
can refuel several times!</p>

<p>Once the plane is level after landing, you can take off again. Remember to gain enough
speed before takeoff!</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: The game ends if you crash, or if you run completely out of ammo and cannot
take off again!!!</p>

<p>ENEMY PLANES:</p>

<p>Enemy planes usually fly in threes. Shoot one and two are left. Go after them! This is
when you need to get fancy with your flying. If they fly left ore right, follow them. If
you need to conserve fuel, try to shoot down as many enemy planes as you can without
climbing or diving.</p>

<p>WINNING TIPS</b></p>

<p>Shoot down as many planes as you can the first time in the air. Don't refuel until you
absolutely need to. The more hits you make, the more ammo you get the next time up!</p>

<p>When you see flak near your sight, pull back the JOYSTICK so you are climbing when you
get hit. This way you won't dive as much you actually get hit.</font></p>
