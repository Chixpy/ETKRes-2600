The test pattern cartridge contains 15 displays that can be used to check or align most
adjustments for a black and white or color television. One pattern is also included to
check the alignment of the color generation circuitry on the Atari VCS &#153; console
circuit board. A 1kHz and 3kHz tone can be selected with the DIFFICULTY SWITCHES, and the
patterns can be selected by scrolling forward or backwards through the list via the GAME
SELECT or GAME RESET console switches.<br>

TITLE PAGE - contains the copyright notice &quot;copyright © 1983 Video Soft&quot;,
indicating that this program is protected under Title 17 United States Code. This screen
also contains the color adjustment pattern for the Atari VCS &#153; color generation
circuits. The VCS generates audio and video signals using digital electronics. The color
phase angles are generated by delaying the color signal until the desired phase angle is
selected. An adjustment potentiometer is placed on the VCS console circuit board to adjust
the 360 degree delay so that it is the same as 0 degrees. Although we do not recommend
that you void any warranty on your game console, the potentiometer (the only one) can be
adjusted so that the top half of the colored box is as close to the same color as the
bottom half. The color generation circuits can then correctly produce colors from 0 to 360
degrees.<br>
<br>
COLOR BAR PATTERN - gives a close approximation to the NTSC standard color bar. The top
colors are gray, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, blue, and black. The bottom colors are
a very dark green, white, blue, and black.<br>
<br>
GREY SCALE PATTERN - produces eight shades across the screen going from white to black.
This pattern can be used to check that the television can reproduce uniform changes in the
luminance amplitude. The brightness and contrast can be adjusted so that all bars are
showing across the screen. NOTE: it is not possible to turn off the color burst signal on
the game console, even with the COLOR/BLACK-WHITE switch. Some color may creep into
pictures which should have only a black and white display.<br>
<br>
CROSS HATCH PATTERN, DOT PATTERN, VERTICAL LINES, HORIZONTAL LINES, and CENTER CROSS - are
very useful for checking vertical and horizontal linearity <br>
on any television, and are also useful for checking and aligning convergence on a color
television.<br>
<br>
CIRCLE PATTERN - is used to adjust the vertical size and linearity. If the vertical size
and/or linearity are out of adjustment, the cycle could appear as an egg instead of being
round.<br>
<br>
WIDE VERTICAL BARS - can be used to test for smearing or fading of the video signal. The
bars should appear as completely white and black bars.<br>
<br>
WINDOW PATTERN - should appear as a white window in a completely black background. If the
black background changes between black and gray at the top or bottom of the window, the DC
coupling or DC restoration between the video amplifier and the picture tube is not
functioning correctly.<br>
<br>
WHITE SCREEN - is used to adjust the color circuits to produce a white screen on a color
television.<br>
<br>
RED SCREEN - is most useful in adjusting color purity. If the screen is not completely
red, (such as other colors around the edges), the television should be degaussed. If
degaussing does not cure the problem, the color purity magnets will probably need
adjustment.<br>
<br>
BLUE SCREEN, GREEN SCREEN - displays blue or green screens.</font></p>
