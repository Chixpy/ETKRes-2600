THE LEVELS OF NEXAR

So, you have ignored our warning.

Very Well!!

Upon presentation of your encoded identity cartridge you will be
sent to the entrance of the space warp.

At each level there are RADIOACTIVE BEACONS that must be
destroyed. These BEACONS are guarded by impact exploding SAUCERS
which guard the BEACONS.
