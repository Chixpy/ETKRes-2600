1. OBJECT OF THE GAME

Each player* controls a blue or red cop.  Your cop's beat is a maze of city
blocks, and you must move the cop from the left side of the maze to the exit
on the right, as shown in the diagram.

*MAZE CRAZE(TM) may be played by one player, depending on the game number you're
playing.  See GAME VARIATIONS and the GAME SELECT MATRIX to determine whether 
anything has to happen to a second player in order for you to exit the maze
and end the game.

2. GAME PLAY

You're a cop confronting danger and suspense as you and your opponent wind your
way across the city blocks.  The first player to reach the exit on the right
side of the maze wins the game.

Throughout the game you may encounter armed robbers, blockades, and other
obstacles to prohibit you from finishing your beat.

You'll hear the footsteps of cops, as well as the sound effects when someone
bumps into a deadend, or the special sound effects when someone exits from
the maze.  You'll also experience the unique sound that occurs when a robber
captures a cop!

The number at the top center of the playfield represents the game number.

SPEED

How fast can your cop react to danger?  The number at the top left side of
the playfield represents the speed at which cops and robbers travel:

1 - medium
2 - fast
3 - slow
4 - calculatingly slow

VISIBILITY

During some games, all or some of the city blocks may suffer blackouts.  The
top right number on the screen represents the amount of the maze you can see
during a game:

1 - Straight forward action with all of the maze visible throughout the game.
2 - A small portion of the maze is invisible.
3 - Danger increases with a large portion of the maze invisible.
4 - The ultimate in suspense with all of the maze invisible.

When a cop exits any of the invisible mazes, the maze appears on the screen.
To select a game number, speed and visibility, press the game select switch.
All of the available game numbers and visibility numbers will appear for
each speed beginning with speed number one.  Continue to press the switch until
the combination of speed, game and visibility you desire appears at the top of
the screen.

3. USING THE CONTROLLERS

Use your Joystick Controllers with this ATARI(R) Game Program(TM) cartridge.
Be sure the Joystick Controller cables are firmly plugged into the RIGHT and
LEFT CONTROLLER jacks at the back of your ATARI Video Computer System(TM) game.
Hold the Joystick with the red button to your upper left, toward the
television screen.  See Section 3 of your owner's manual for further details.

To move your cop, push the Joystick forward, backward, left or right.

Press the red controller button to:

* Select a new maze for the game you've just completed.
* Use features offered in some games (See the GAME VARIATIONS section for a 
  detailed breakdown of these features).

to play.

GAME RESET SWITCH

Use this switch to start game play, to choose a different maze for the game
you've selected, or to see an invisible maze before you exit.

left difficulty switch; the right player uses the right difficulty switch.

TV TYPE SWITCH

Set this switch to color if you have a color television set.  Set it to b-w

5. GAME VARIATIONS

Each game offers different variations or features which can assist or hinder
you in finding your way out of the maze.

CAPTURE - You must become a hero and capture thre robbers before you win the
game.  To do this, move your cop toward the robber and make contact.  During
games that feature CAPTURE, coor or coded bars appear for each player at the
top of the screen.  Each time you capture a robber, the appropriate bar
disappears. (Blue bar = blue robber)

2, 3 OR 5 ROBBERS - Depending on the game you're playing, two, three or five
robbers appear on the right side of the screen.  They will be lurking around 
corners waiting for you.  If they touch you, you automatically are knocked out
of the game and lose.

WOUNDS - You're paralized after robbers touch you.  Only after a few moments
will you regain strength, and then you can gradually move at your normal speed.

NOTE: A wounded cop continues to move in the same direction that he was headed 
when he was wounded.  Only at the next intersection can you change the
cop's direction.

TERROR - Your cop cannot exit the maze until your opponent is knocked out of
the maze by the robbers.

BLOCKADE - Confuse your opponent by leaving a blockade resembling a deadend
in the maze.  He can go through it, of course, but blockades can be useful
strategy.  Press the red controller button to leave a blockade.  When you
set up a new blockade, the previous one disappears.

AUTOMATIC PEEK - This is your way out of the darkness!  During invisible mazes
or blackouts, the computer flashes the complete maze on the screen every few
seconds.  Try to recognize the way out before your opponent.

PLAYER PEEK - During invisible games, a player can peek at the complete maze
by pressing the red controller button.  The maze remains on the screen
momentarily.

SCOUTS - During invisible mazes, your cop has a partmer or scout who moves
ahead of him.  The scout randomly leads the way, but you are free to ignore
his suggestions.

NOTE: All of the 16 MAZE CRAZE games have four visibility options.  GAMES 6
and 7 feature additional variations.  GAME 6 with visibility 1 is a 5 ROBBERS
Game Variation.  GAME 6 with all other visibilities is a PLAYER PEEK Game
Variation.  GAME 7 with visibility 1 combines the 5 ROBBERS and TERROR Game
Variations.  GAME 7 with all other visibilities is a SCOUTS Game Variation.
All other games allow you to choose your visibility options.  See GAME SELECT
MATRIX for game variations.
