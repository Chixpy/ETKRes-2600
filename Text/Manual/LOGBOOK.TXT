LOG BOOK

A RECORD OF
YOUR GREATEST HITS
ON YOUR ATARI(R)
VIDEO COMPUTER SYSTEM(TM)

Introduction
------------

The more you play your ATARI(R) Game Program(TM) cartridges, the better you
get.  Now you can find out how good you really are!

The ATARI engineers chose 40 challenging games from among the hundreds of Game
Program(TM) cartridges.  Their selection is listed here, along with three
scores for each game -- Outrageous, Great, and Good -- and spaces to record the
date you hit each score.

(At the back of the book are some blank forms for recording memorable scores
from other games you like, and new games as they come out.)

So, grab a joystick or a Paddle, and get ready to chronicle your greatest hits
on your ATARI(R) Video Computer System(TM) game.
