<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">Intergalactic Combat Manual </h2>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">[picture of spaceships above a planet] </p>

<p>Piloting your space craft to the outer reaches of the galaxy, on the fringes of
hyperspace and hypertime, you find you are trapped in a Space/Time Warp the immobilizes
your ship. From nowhere comes a band of space pirates out to destroy you and your crew.
Your Tachyon Launcher--firing lethal particles that travel faster then light--is still
operational, but even this space-age artillery can't save you unless your fighting
reflexes are in top form. </p>

<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">A Data Age<sub>TM</sub> Video Game </h2>

<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">Mission Objectives </h2>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Taking aim at the tormenters swarming outside your space craft's main
View Port, you must destroy the space bandits' ships before they get you. At the same
time, you must avoid the Photon Bombs with which some of your attackers are equipped. </p>

<h2>How to Fight the Battle </h2>

<ol>
  <li>Hook up your video game system according to the manufacturer's instructions. </li>
  <li>With game console power OFF, firmly plug in your WARPLOCK<sup>TM</sup> game cartridge. </li>
  <li>Turn game console power ON. If no picture appears, check to make sure your game unit is
    hooked up correctly to your TV, then try steps 1-3 again. </li>
  <li>For the best contrast, turn the &quot;Brightness&quot; control switch on your TV to a
    low setting. (For even more realistic effects, turn down the room lights and watch the
    wake left by the space bandit ships as they blare across your screen.) </li>
  <li>Plug your paddle controllers into your game console's left receptacle. Hold the
    controller with the red Fire Button to your upper left. For two players, use both
    controllers. (Player 1 uses the left controller, and Player 2 uses the right controller.) </li>
  <li>Select the game you wish to play (one or two player version) by depressing the
    &quot;Game Select&quot; switch on your game unit console. The number of players will
    appear in the upper right corner of your viewing screen. </li>
  <li>To begin game play, depress your &quot;Game Reset&quot; switch, then press the red Fire
    Button on your paddle controller. When Player 1's space craft is struck, his turn is over,
    and he must press the &quot;Game Reset&quot; switch to begin a new game. If there are two
    players, Player 2 must press his red Fire Button to start his turn. Once Player 2's turn
    is over, you depress either the &quot;Game Reset&quot; switch or Player 1's red Fire
    Button to begin a new game. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Scoring </h2>

<p>You will score one point for each enemy ship that you hit. Move your Tachyon Launcher
to the left or the right with your paddle controller, pressing your Fire Button to launch
Tachyon Energy Rods on their deadly mission. Once your score has reached 99, your score
block indicators will return to zero and begin again at 1 point. </p>

score, enemy ships, photon bombs, tachyon energy rods, and the tachyon launcher.] </p>

<p>The game will escalate in difficulty as the enemy ships increase in speed and number.
Once you have scored sixteen hits (16 points) the enemy craft will begin dropping Photon
Bombs--a potentially explosive situation! </p>
