Adventures of 
TRON

INSTRUCTIONS



 




(For 1 Player)





The object of the game is to keep your man, TRON, alive and scoring
points.  Keep him moving from side-to-side and floor-to-floor.  Send him up
the elevators.  Jump him down a floor.  Or slide him down the center INPUT/
OUTPUT beam.  Wave after wave of Master Control Program attackers
must be avoided - deadly Recognizers and Grid Bugs, even cannon-firing
tanks.  At the start, TRON has 4 lives, 1 on the screen, 3 in reserve.

THE GAME

------------------------------------------------------------------------






You'll play one man at a time.  Alone, your man TRON must avoid  
attackers on a grid with four floors.  Keep him moving, keep him healthy
- riding up the elevators, jumping down floors.  Have TRON hitch a 
ride on a Solar Sailer!  Points are scored my maneuvering TRON into
position to intercept flying "bits" floating by overhead.  Top floor
points count extra.  Stay alert!  There's no place to hide.





THE CONTROLS





Use your joystick controllers with this game.  Be sure the controller cables 
are securely plugged into the back of your game console.  Each player holds
the controller so that the red FIRING BUTTON is to the UPPER LEFT.






------------------------------------------------------------------------

KEEP HIM MOVING!








•Push joystick LEFT to make man run toward screen left.
•Push joystick RIGHT to make man run toward screen right.
•Press RED BUTTON to...

•make man jump.
•make man drop off the Solar Sailer.

•Push joystick FORWARD to...

•move man up the elevator
•to slow down his fall on the INPUT/OUTPUT BEAM.


•Pull joystick BACK to...

•to SLOW elevator's upward move
•to fall FASTER on the INPUT/OUTPUT BEAM.
•to JUMP down a floor. (hold down LONGER & jump down more than one floor.)









IMPORTANT:  Elevators will NOT work unless TRON CROSSES the 
I/O BEAM at the center of your screen.  On the ground floor just walk him 
across.  On the upper floors you must make him JUMP across the center I/O BEAM.
(Try to walk him across and TRON will FALL DOWN the INPUT/OUTPUT BEAM!)





DIFFICULTY SWITCHES





Only the LEFT Difficulty Switch makes any difference in game play.  In
"B" position, all the various levels of play go SLOWER.  (Game gets
harder - cannon-firing tanks appear as more points are scored.)





"A" Difficulty position is for experienced players ONLY.  Everything 
speeds up dramatically in position "A".  (Tanks appear at once and 
everything comes in from different sides.)





SELECT DIFFICULTY ("A" OR "B" SETTING) BEFORE GAME STARTS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO PLAY





Turn game on...





1.  Depress console RESET button.





2.  TITLE will appear on TV Screen.





3.  Push either JOYSTICK and PLAY BEGINS!  Use RED button to make
man jump.  Use JOYSTICK to maneuver.





MORE ABOUT GAME PLAY





•When game starts, you have FOUR lives to lose.  One man on your screen at a time.  The grid has FOUR floors.

•All it takes is ONE enemy contact and your man is eliminated.  (Until
ALL four lives are lost, man is automatically replaced.)

•You must avoid 3 KINDS of MCP attackers:  RECOGNIZERS, GRID BUGS 
and CANNON-FIRING TANKS (in the more difficult levels.)

•MCP attackers appear on the TOP FLOOR first.  They move across the
screen horizontally until they reach an edge.  They then DROP down 
one FLOOR and move horizontally in the OPPOSITE direction.  Attackers
snake their way downward until they exit on the GROUND FLOOR.  (In 
harder game levels, attackers alternate the side they enter by.)

•ELEVATORS UP or the I/O (INPUT/OUTPUT) BEAM DOWN are good ways to dodge 
enemy action.  Elevators go up one floor only.  And you must CROSS the center
I/O BEAM before they work.  You CAN CONTROL how fast your man moves up or down 
the elevator or I/O Beam by using the Joystick.  Sliding down the I/O Beam also activates the elevators for a trip back up.

•You can jump your man down any number of floors, depending on HOW LONG you 
pull joystick BACK and hold it.  (See previous page.)

•Don't forget the Solar Sailer!  It's another way out of danger.  Make TRON 
jump up and hitch a ride.

•Points are won by maneuvering TRON into position to intercept (capture) 
floating "BITS".  EXTRA points for upper floor captures. (See "SCORING," below.)

•When you have captured ALL 7 floating "BITS", SCREEN WILL TURN BLUE.  
Survivor will then get a free trip up the Input/Output Beam, right off the 
screen.  (I/O Beam may be entered from ANY floor.)  Now you are into a NEW 
SCREEN.  PLAY BEGINS AGAIN at a faster, more difficult level.  Score 2,000 BONUS
POINTS for each new screen.

•If MCP attackers take all four lives, the GAME IS OVER!  DEPRESS RESET
SWITCH & START A NEW GAME.









IMPORTANT:  Be sure to turn your game unit OFF when not in use.

WINNING TIPS





FOLLOW the MCP attackers with your man instead of leading them. It's safer with
RECOGNIZERS & GRID BUGS.  What's more - TANKS CANNOT shoot backwards!





DON'T TRY to jump over a RECOGNIZER or a TANK on the upper 3 floors!  It's hard!
(On the ground floor jumping over tanks & Grid Bugs is easier!)





WATCH the screen edges!  Don't get blind-sided.  Attackers have a very nasty 
habit of entering a floor above or below just when your man arrives up the 
elevator!





PRACTICE COORDINATING the JOYSTICK & RED JUMP BUTTON.  Do this enough times 
until it's second nature.





ALWAYS start your man on the GROUND FLOOR and work up gradually.  You'll have 
more time to get your bearings, pick up the easier scoring bits as you move him
up.
