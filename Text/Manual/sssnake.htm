<br>
You are a daring big game hunter on an expedition into the heart of the<br>
Amazon's legendary lost world. But you find that the game being hunted is<br>
you -- by Pterodactyls, Trachodons, and other prehistoric creatures. Luckily<br>
you find refuge in an ancient abandoned fortress, where you're protected<br>
from the jungle outside. Or are you . . . . .<br>
<br>
<br>
A Data Age (tm) Video Game<br>
<br>
Expedition Objectives<br>
<br>
Your objective is to score as many points as possible by<br>
shooting the prehistoric creatures that prowl outside the<br>
ancient fortress walls. But at the same time you must avoid<br>
contact with the deadly snakes that can slither in and out<br>
of your jungle hiding place.<br>
<br>
How To Hunt Prehistoric Predators<br>
<br>
1. Hook up your video game system according to the manufacturer's <br>
instructions.<br>
<br>
2. With game console power OFF, firmly plug in your SSSNAKE (tm) game<br>
cartridge.<br>
<br>
3. Turn game console power ON. If no picture appears, check to make sure your <br>
game unit is hooked up correctly to your TV, then try steps 1-3 again.<br>
<br>
4. For best contrast, turn the &quot;Brightness&quot; control switch on your TV to a<br>
low setting.<br>
<br>
5. Plug your joystick controllers into the left receptacle of your game <br>
console. For two players, use both joystick controllers. Player 1 uses the <br>
left controller and Player 2 uses the right controller.<br>
<br>
6. Select the game variation you want by depressing the &quot;Game Select&quot; switch <br>
on your game console. The game number will appear in the upper right hand<br>
corner of your screen. There are two variations of SSSNAKE (tm): In Game<br>
No. 1, the snakes come only from one direction; in Game No. 2, there are<br>
snakes coming from two directions.<br>
<br>
7. To start the game, push down the &quot;Game Reset&quot; switch on your console unit.<br>
(This switch may also be used to restart the game at any time.)<br>
<br>
8. When a single player's turn is over, push down the &quot;Reset&quot; switch to begin<br>
a new game. If there are two players, Player Two must press the red Fire<br>
Button on his joystick controller to start his turn. Once Player Two's<br>
turn is over, push down the &quot;Game Reset&quot; switch to begin a new game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Scoring<br>
<br>
You will score a point each time your powerful Cluster Gun strikes a preh-<br>
istoric creature. Sometimes these predators travel together in groups of<br>
two or even three. The &quot;blast effect&quot; from your Cluster Gun will knock out<br>
all the creatures even if you hit only one (but you'll still score just one<br>
point). Once your score has reached 99, the score indicator will return to<br>
zero and begin at 1 point.<br>
<br>
<br>

SCORE&quot;;TOP-<br>
RIGHT, TWO SNAKES AND A PREHISTORIC CREATURE, AND THE &quot;FORTRESS&quot;; CENTRE, <br>
WITH YOUR &quot;GUN&quot;. THE &quot;GUN TRACK&quot; IS OUTLINED (NOT VISIBLE ON TV
DISPLAY).]<br>
<br>
<br>
Position your gun by moving your joystick controller at exact right angles.<br>
The gun moves along the Gun Track which runs along the fortress walls, and<br>
the gun shoots away from the fortress. Using your red Fire Button, try<br>
hitting as many of the prehistoric creatures as you can, while at the same<br>
time avoiding contact with the deadly snakes.<br>
<br>
<br>
ADDITIONAL SURVIVAL STRATEGIES<br>
<br>
The snakes cannot be killed, and you score no points for hitting a snake.<br>
But the name of the game here is survival, and cutting the snakes down to<br>
size is the key to racking up a big score.<br>
<br>
Hitting a snake with your Cluster Gun can knock out one or more segments,<br>
breaking the snake in two or shortening its overall length. In either case,<br>
the snake will become easier to avoid.<br>
<br>
<br>
HERE ARE SOME THINGS TO REMEMBER:<br>
<br>
1. Some snakes move faster than others, and some are more vulnerable to <br>
your weapon than others. Keeping your red Fire Button depressed while<br>
aiming at a snake will increase your chances of knocking out segments.<br>
<br>
2. In Game No.1 there are snakes coming only from one direction, but they<br>
move fast. In Game No.2, while there are snakes from two directions, the <br>
snakes may actually be easier to cut down because they are moving more<br>
slowly.<br>
<br>
3. The red squares on your screen are barriers like bricks in the fortress<br>
walls, petrified trees, etc. You cannot shoot through them.<br>
<br>
4. To keep your weapon on the Gun Track, be sure to move your joystick<br>
control at exact right angles -- otherwise you won't be able to move the<br>
Cluster Gun to a new firing position.<br>
