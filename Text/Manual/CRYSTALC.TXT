CRYSTAL CASTLES
The A-maze-ing Adventures of Bentley Bear


A BEARABLE TALE

Once upon a time, Bentley Bear was rambling through the woods,
daydreaming about poached salmon.  He stopped to take a nap in his
favorite hollow tree trunk.  But when he awoke, he found himself inside
a huge castle glittering with diamonds, emeralds, and pearls.

Though Bentley didn't know it at the time, he was trapped in Crystal
Castles, home of Berthilda the Witch and her evil cronies.  To escape
their spell, he must harvest the gems in the castles before Berthilda
and her malicious gang send him into permanent hibernation.

How to Play Crystal Castles

  VCS as explained in your owner's guide, and turn on the POWER switch.

  castles by jumping over them.  Press the red joystick button, and
  Bentley jumps in the direction the joystick is pointing.

  your joystick button to start the game again.

THE BEAR ESSENTIALS

Game Play

You begin CRYSTAL CASTLES at level 1 through 8, but Bentley can trample
through level after level, as long as he survives his enemies.  Each
level has four castles.  Bentley has five lives and must outmaneuver a
maximum of seven creatures, depending on the castle.  At every 20,000
points, he wins an extra life.

The Magic Hat

Bentley can make himself temporarily invincible if he dons the magic
hat by running or jumping over it.  Wherever a witch appears, so does
the magic hat.  No enemy can pass through this headgear.  At game level
4 and above, the hat bounces up and down; at game level 9 and above, it
turns into a crystal ball if Bentley doesn't grab it immediately.

Don the Magic Hat: 500 points

PAWS FOR SOME STRATEGY TIPS

o If Bentley harvests the last gem in the castles, he wins extra points.

O Elevators make perfect escape routes.  However, they only operate one
at a time.

o Bentley is invincible while he's jumping.

o Bentley can temporarily stun Nasty Trees and Gem Eaters by jumping
over them.  But this maneuver won't work if he's wearing the magic hat,
or while the Gem Eaters are swallowing gems.

o When floating scores appear on the scene, creatures can't move
through them; nor can the creatures move through each other.
