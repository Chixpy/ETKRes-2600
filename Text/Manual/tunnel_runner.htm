<strong><big><big>TUNNEL RUNNER</big></big></strong> (tm)<br>
<br>
For the Atari 2600. <br>
For one player.<br>
<br>
TUNNEL RUNNER is Dick &quot;Bucko&quot; Balaska's first game for CBS Electronics. <br>
Married with a finite number of children, he makes his home deep in the<br>
crustacean layer of Connecticut. DB graciously thanks Cindy and Isis for<br>
their countenance while he lived inside &quot;TR&quot; (It's rumored that his flat<br>
is still somewhere in there). His hobbies are fast bikes and fast chips.<br>
<br>
Kudos also go out to Trevor Marshall and Lou Abbagnaro for their support<br>
and to Col Stone for his outstanding computer graphics. A round of applause<br>
to Andy Frank, the man responsible for the eerie sounds of Tunnel Runner.<br>
And a special note of thanks to Rich Eckerstrom and Dan Rappaport for<br>
keeping things going when the going got weird. (Can we go home now, Rich?)<br>

RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!<br>
<br>
Get a move on, TUNNEL RUNNER. Those monstrous Maze Zots have picked up your<br>
scent and there's only one item on their menu --- you! You've been running<br>
up and down tunnels like a rat for so long, you're starting to develop a <br>
taste for cheese. Oh sure, you can get out . . . you just haven't been able<br>
to find the Key to the right Escape Door, that's all. Wait! There it is!<br>
Quickly --- pick it up and start making tracks for that door! You can hear<br>
one of those Zots hot on your heels! No time to check the map --- this <br>
better be the right way! There's a door up ahead. You did it! You're free!<br>
<br>
Sorry, Tunnel Runner, not quite . . . . .<br>
<br>
<br>
OBJECT OF THE GAME<br>
<br>
The object of Tunnel Runner is to successfully escape from an endless series<br>
of colorful, complex, three-dimensional mazes called Runs. To do this you<br>
must first find the key hidden in each Run. While in a Run, points are scored<br>
for every new Room you enter. Bonus points are awarded based on how long it<br>
takes you to escape from each Run.<br>
<br>
<br>
TUNNEL VISION<br>
<br>
In TUNNEL RUNNER, You, not a dot on the screen, are actually in the game,<br>
surrounded by walls as far as the eye can see. The built-in RAM PLUS (tm)<br>
Power Chip makes this unique first-person perspective possible. What you see<br>
on the screen is what actually lies right in front of you. IN OTHER WORDS,<br>
YOU CAN ONLY &quot;SEE&quot; STRAIGHT AHEAD NO MATTER WHAT DIRECTION YOU'RE POINTED IN.<br>
It may take a few games before you get used to this &quot;Tunnel Vision&quot;.<br>
<br>
You begin each game with three lives. The solid squares in the upper Score<br>
Line indicate how many of your lives are left.<br>
<br>
_________________<br>
| | Use your Joystick Controller to maneuver within each Run. <br>
| | Hold the Joystick with the red button to your upper left <br>
| | toward the screen. Push it forward and you'll move ahead; <br>
| PICTURE | pull it back and you'll move backwards. As you move, <br>
| OF | you'll hear a footstep for every step you take. To change <br>
| JOYSTICK | the direction you're pointed in, push the Joystick to the <br>
| | left or right. These actions also have their own charac-<br>
| | teristic sounds. Throughout each Run you'll have to <br>
|_________________| change direction in order to turn corners and/or enter <br>
Escape Doors.<br>
<br>
[SCREEN SHOT SHOWING TUNNEL AHEAD WITH CORNERS TO YOUR LEFT &amp; RIGHT AND A <br>
ZOT FACING YOU. YOUR SCORE LINE; TOP RIGHT &amp; YOUR TIME LINE; BOTTOM RIGHT]<br>
<br>
If, at any time, you crash into a wall, you'll hear a loud thud indicating<br>
a need to try a different direction.<br>
<br>
You will be awarded one extra life for every 1000 points scored up to a<br>
maximum of four lives in reserve at any particular time.<br>
<br>
<br>
RUNS<br>
<br>
Runs are made up of intricate patterns of walls which form the twisting<br>
tunnels and corridors you must run through. As you move down a tunnel, <br>
you'll notice breaks in the wall pattern. These breaks indicate corners.<br>
You can turn a corner by changing the direction you're pointed in. As you<br>
approach the intersection, ready yourself on the Joystick. As soon as you<br>
reach it, push the Joystick in the direction of the desired turn and you'll<br>
then be looking down a new tunnel. After some practice, you'll be speeding<br>
down tunnels and turning corners like a pro!<br>
<br>
<br>
FLOORS<br>
<br>
The floor of each Run is divided into colored sections, each new color<br>
representing one Room of the Run. Points are scored every time you run into<br>
a Room for the first time within that Run. Point value is determined by the<br>
Run number. For example: In Run 1, you'll receive 1 point for every Room you<br>
enter for the first time; in Run 2, 2 points; Run 3, 3 points; etc.<br>
<br>
A flashing floor section indicates the presence of one of the four different<br>
types of escape doors scattered throughout each Run. As soon as you come to <br>
the middle of a flashing floor section, you'll automatically stop dead in<br>
your tracks. You may then look around in all directions to find the Escape<br>
Door embedded in one of the surrounding walls. After doing so, you may decide<br>
to enter the Escape Door (if you can) or keep on running in whatever direc-<br>
tion is available to you. The choice is yours.<br>
<br>
Of course, you may resume running immediately upon entering a flashing floor<br>
section without taking time to examine the Escape Door.<br>
<br>
<br>
ESCAPE DOORS<br>
<br>
Each flashing floor section contains only one Escape Door.<br>
<br>
<br>
UP &amp; DOUBLE-UP DOORS<br>
_________________<br>
| _____ | These are the doors that a Tunnel Runner must seek out<br>
| / \ | if he/she expects to progress to the next Run. A door<br>
| / / \ \ | with one arrow pointing up indicates a safe way out of<br>
|/\ | / \ | /\| the Run and into the next, more challenging one. A door<br>
| | _| | | with two arrows pointing up will send you into a Run TWO<br>
| | | | levels higher than the Run you've just escaped from.<br>
| |_________| |<br>
| |<br>
|_________________|<br>
<br>
<br>
_________________ <br>
|_________________| To enter either one of these Escape Doors, you must first <br>
|_______/ \_______| find the flashing Key located elsewhere on the Run floor.<br>
|______/ \______| Once you see it, pass over it to pick it up (your Compass<br>
|_____/ \_____| arrow in the lower left corner of the screen will then <br>
|____/ \____| begin to flash). It is impossible to enter an Up or <br>
|___/ \___| Double-Up Door without the Key. <br>
|__/___________\__|<br>
|_________________|<br>
|_________________|<br>
<br>
There is only one Key per Run and when you pick it up you'll be able to<br>
keep it for as long as you're in the Run, even if a Maze Zot catches you.<br>
<br>
<br>
TRANSPORTS<br>
_________________ <br>
| _____ | A door with two arrows pointing inward indicates a <br>
| / \ | Transport. A Transport will toss you around the Run<br>
| / / \ \ | you're in and drop you off in a random location. <br>
|-&gt; | / \ | &lt;-| Sometimes this location may be a few Rooms away from <br>
| | _| | | where you initially entered the Transport; sometimes <br>
| | | | it may be somewhere on the other side of the Run. <br>
| |_________| | <br>
| | You do not need a Key to enter a Transport. <br>
|_________________|<br>
<br>
<br>
DOWN DOORS<br>
_________________ <br>
| _____ | A door with two arrows pointing down indicates a Down <br>
| / \ | Door. Entry into a Down Door will force you into the <br>
| / / \ \ | preceding Run. While trapped in that Run, you will <br>
| | / \ | | receive no points for running through Rooms and no <br>
|\/ | _| | \/| bonus points upon escape. Obviously, you should not <br>
| | | | enter a Down Door unless you feel you have no other <br>
| |_________| | choice. <br>
| | <br>
|_________________| You do not need a Key to enter a Down Door. <br>
<br>
<br>
ESCAPE BONUS<br>
<br>
When you find the Key and manage to escape through an Up or Double-Up door,<br>
you'll receive bonus points based upon the time left on your Time Line when<br>
you escaped. The higher the level of Run you escape from, the greater the<br>
bonus point potential.<br>
<br>
If no time is left on your Time Line upon your escape, you'll be forced to<br>
repeat the same Run for no points. Only when you escape from that Run again,<br>
will you be allowed to score points on more challenging Runs.<br>
<br>
Once your bonus points are awarded, your Time Line will be recharged for your<br>
attempt at escaping from the next Run.<br>
<br>
<br>
MAPS<br>
<br>
Previous, less successful Tunnel Runners have left behind special Maps for<br>
each of the Runs you'll find yourself trapped in. Ideally, a Map will show<br>
you the following:<br>
<br>
* the entire area of the Run you're in.<br>
<br>
* your position in the Run and the direction you're headed in (as<br>
indicated by the yellow arrow).<br>
<br>
* the position and direction of movement of the Maze Zots (as indicated<br>
by the colored circles in motion).<br>
<br>
[SCREEN SHOT OF MAP DISPLAY SHOWING WHOLE MAP OF RUN AREA. YOU'RE LOCATION;<br>
A YELLOW ARROW, AND A ZOT; COLORED CIRCLE. YOUR COMPASS; BOTTOM LEFT]<br>
<br>
A Map will never show you:<br>
<br>
* the location of the Key.<br>
<br>
* the layout of Rooms within a Run.<br>
<br>
* the location of Escape Doors.<br>
<br>
<br>
However, as you progress into more challenging Runs, you'll quickly discover<br>
that some Maps are more useful than others.<br>
<br>
To check the Map, press down on the red button on your Joystick Controller<br>
and hold it down for as long as you want to look at the Map.<br>
<br>
While checking the Map, you're prevented from both moving and changing<br>
direction. Maze Zots, however, are constantly in motion. You can use your<br>
Map to note their movements and relative speeds in addition to marking<br>
their location.<br>
<br>
<br>
MAZE ZOTS<br>
<br>
Each Run is filled with different species of Maze Zots, monstrous little<br>
fellows with a keen sense of smell and a huge appetite for Tunnel Runners.<br>
Each Zot has his own sound and characteristics:<br>
<br>
<br>
GREY ZOT<br>
_________________ <br>
| ___________ | Slow, dumb and careless. Fairly easy to avoid on<br>
| /___________\ | initial Runs.<br>
| || .| |. || | <br>
| ||___|---|___|| | <br>
| | _ ___ _ | | <br>
| | \\_/ \_// | |<br>

<br>
<br>
WHITE ZOT<br>
_________________ <br>
| ___________ | Faster and smarter. Will quickly sniff out your trail,<br>
| /___________\ | but you should be able to outrun him.<br>
| || .| |. || | <br>
| ||___|---|___|| | <br>
| | _ ___ _ | | <br>
| | \\_/ \_// | |<br>
| \ \__---__/ / |<br>
| \_________/ |<br>
|_________________|<br>
<br>
<br>
RED ZOT<br>
_________________ <br>
| ___________ | Graduated at the &quot;head&quot; of his class from Zot U. The<br>
| /___________\ | quickest, most intelligent Zot of all.<br>
| || .| |. || | <br>
| ||___|---|___|| | <br>
| | _ ___ _ | | <br>
| | \\_/ \_// | |<br>
| \ \__---__/ / |<br>
| \_________/ |<br>
|_________________|<br>
<br>
<br>
In Run 1, only the Grey Zot will be present. Run 2 contains the Grey Zot<br>
and the White Zot. All Runs after that contain all three little nasties.<br>
As you progress into new, more challenging Runs, each Zot becomes faster,<br>
smarter and hungrier.<br>
<br>
At no time can a Zot enter into an Escape Door.<br>
<br>
If a Zot manages to catch you, you forfeit the life in play and your next<br>
life starts at a random location within the same Run.<br>
<br>
<br>
SPECIAL FEATURES<br>
<br>
Compass<br>
<br>
Your Compass is located in the lower left corner of your screen in the Time <br>
Line. It indicates the direction of your movement relative to the Map of<br>
the Run. The Compass is a useful tool for keeping track of where you're<br>
going, especially when you're trapped in a Run whose Map does not reveal<br>
your location.<br>
<br>
Speed<br>
<br>
The longer you hold your Joystick in either the forward or backward position,<br>
the faster your speed of movement. The higher the level of Run, the greater<br>
your maximum speed potential.<br>
<br>
Maze Mysteries<br>
<br>
The more expert you become at TUNNEL RUNNER, the greater your chances of<br>
running into some of it's many secrets including some mysterious maze magic!<br>
These secret features may confuse you at first, but in the long run (pardon <br>
the pun) they'll increase the challenge and make playing TUNNEL RUNNER even<br>
more exciting!<br>
<br>
<br>
END OF GAME<br>
<br>
The game ends when you forfeit your last life in the brave but futile<br>
attempt to escape from the monstrous Maze Zots.<br>
<br>
<br>
GAME VERSIONS<br>
<br>
Game 1 -- Memorized Mazes. Runs increase in challenge and complexity<br>
following a predetermined pattern. The layout of each Run,<br>
including Key and Escape Door locations, will stay the same each<br>
time you play.<br>
<br>
Game 2 -- Torture Tunnels. Thanks to the expanded memory provided by<br>
RAM PLUS technology, players may also select randomly-generated<br>
Runs. These Run layouts will almost never appear more than once.<br>
<br>
<br>
SCORING<br>
<br>
Your score is displayed in the Score Line at the top of the screen through-<br>
out the game.<br>
<br>
________________________________________________________________________<br>
| Point Values: |<br>
|________________________________________________________________________|<br>
| Entering a Room |<br>
| for the first time 1 point x Run number |<br>
|________________________________________________________________________|<br>
| Successfully escaping Variable; based on time |<br>
| from a Run remaining on Time Line. |<br>

|________________________________________________________________________|<br>
<br>
<br>
STRATEGY HINTS<br>
<br>
1. Keep your ears open! The more familiar you become with each Maze Zot's<br>
characteristic sound, the better you'll be at making quick decisions<br>
to run or wait without having to check the Map.<br>
<br>
2. Learn to run and turn without stopping. Turn into a corner in advance<br>
of actually coming to the intersection and push up on the Joystick<br>
immediately after making the turn. You'll be able to keep up your<br>
momentum.<br>
<br>
3. Don't spend too much time staring at the Map. Remember that the maze<br>
Zots are constantly in motion and you're prevented from moving as long<br>
as the Map is on the screen.<br>
<br>
