OBJECT
------
Brush off your ace piloting skills because you're about to take off on a hair-
raising adventure: air surveillance of unfriendly territory. This means a
10,000-mile obstacle course through ever-changing terrain...over craggy
mountain tops, around tall city buildings, through long jagged tunnels. And
that isn't all! The course is just rigged with chopper-stopping weapons like
igniting rockets, heavy ground artillery, flying fireballs, and falling mines.

Every 1,000 miles of terrain brings ever-increasing challenges and ever-
certain...danger. But a handsome payoff lies at the end for anyone who's got
what it takes.

SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS
----------------------------
1. Since this is a one-player game, plug the Joystick controller firmly into
the LEFT controller jack.

2. Select a game speed: SLOW, MEDIUM, or FAST. (These are the speeds at which
your chopper flies.) To do this, simply press down the GAME SELECT switch. IF
YOU SKIP THIS STEP, YOU'LL AUTOMATICALLY GET THE MEDIUM SPEED.

3. Press GAME RESET and you're ready to fly.

THE JOYSTICK
------------
Use the Joystick to maneuver your chopper up, down, and to the right. When you
move left, the chopper "hovers."
Each press of the FIRE BUTTON releases one missile, then drops one bomb.

"PAUSE" BUTTON
--------------
If, at any time during the game, you wish to "freeze" the action and your score
on screen, press the TV TYPE switch from "COLOR" to "B-W." When you are ready
to play again, simply reset the switch to "COLOR."

PLAYING
-------
You'll start the game with four choppers. The first appears in action while the
remaining three wait "on deck" at the bottom of the scree.

As soon as you press RESET, start to fly your chopper down screen to the right.
The object is to avoid the obstacles that border around the chopper's air route
in order to gain points for mileage. Hit an obstacle, and the chopper goes
down. When a chopper goes down, the next one comes up and begins at the start
of the same level where the last one crashed.

In addition to gaining mileage, try to shoot down for points the weapons
scattered throughout the course. You'll find four diffrent types of weapons:
ground artillery, rockets, fireballs, and mines. The type of weapon you'll find
and whether it's activated or not will differ, depending on the level at which
you're playing. Just remember: dodge its fire, don't run your chopper into it,
and try to shoot it down for points.

(Picture shows examples of Ground Artillery, Fuel Tank, Rocket, Fireball, and
Mines.)

FUEL TANKS
   The blue bar at the bottom of the screen is your fuel gauge. Keep an eye on
   it because if your fuel runs out, your chopper is out of luck. You can
   replenish your fuel supply by hitting a fuel tank. As the fuel depletes to a
   dangerous level, you'll hear a warning sound. This tells you to fly to a
   tank quick and fill up.

LEVELS 1-11: THE OBSTACLE COURSE
--------------------------------
Notice the band at the top of the screen. Each block in the band represents
1,000 miles of the obstacle course - or one game level. There are 11 levels in
all. Every time your chopper enters a new level, its corresponding block turns
yellow.

Survive one level (with at least one remaining chopper) and you'll hear a brief
musical tune. In a moment, you'll cruise into the next level and a different
section of the obstacle course.

Each level not only shows a different air route, but also displays different
combinations of active and inactive weapons. Here's a rundown of what you'll
encounter in each game level:
--------------------------------------------------------
Level  1: Rockets and ground artillery both inactive.
--------------------------------------------------------
Level  2: Rockets ignite, ground artillery inactive.
--------------------------------------------------------
Level  3: Flying fireballs active.
--------------------------------------------------------
Level  4: Rockets ignite, ground artillery fires.
--------------------------------------------------------
Level  5: Ground artillery fires, rockets ignite.
--------------------------------------------------------
Level  6: Mines inactive, rockets ignite, ground artil-
          lery fires, fireballs inactive.
--------------------------------------------------------
Level  7: Mines drop bombs, rockets ignite, ground
          artillery inactive, fireballs inactive.
--------------------------------------------------------
Level  8: Fireballs active.
--------------------------------------------------------
Level  9: Rockets ignite, mines drop bombs, ground
          artillery fires.
--------------------------------------------------------
Level 10: Same as Level 9.
--------------------------------------------------------
Level 11: Here's where the booty lies. Ground artillery
          and rockets both active.
--------------------------------------------------------

THE BOOTY
---------
When you reach Level 11, the object is to pick up the booty by swooping down
and landing on it. If you can accomplish this, there will be a slight pause in
the action. After a brief musical tune, you'll go back to Level 1.

(Picture of Booty, which looks like a large dollar sign ($).)

END OF GAME
-----------
The game ends when you run out of choppers.

SPECIAL FEATURE: If you press the FIRE BUTTON IMMEDIATELY after the game ends
(within 5 seconds), you'll start again at the beginning of the level where you
left off, instead of starting at the very beginning of the game. Your score
will begin again at zero.

TO PLAY AGAIN AT THE SAME SPEED, press the FIRE BUTTON or RESET.

TO PLAY AGAIN AT A DIFFERENT SPEED, press GAME SELECT for the speed of your
choice. Then press the FIRE BUTTON or RESET.

SCORING
-------
Hitting ground artillery....................100 points
Hitting a rocket.............................50 points
Hitting a fireball...........................50 points
Hitting a mine...............................50 points
Picking up booty...........................5000 points
Points also accumulate as you gain mileage: 900 points
