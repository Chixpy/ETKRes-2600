ABSOLUTE ENTERTAINMENT

&quot;I Play Baseball One Way.....All Out!&quot;  
Pete Rose 

Here's the first 2600 Baseball game to live up to this winning attitude.

* From the crack of the bat, make split second decisions as you choose which
  fielder makes the play.
* Throw popular Major League pitches - fast balls, curves, change-ups, 
  screwballs and sinkers. (Spitballs?)
* Head to head action with your friends or against the computer.
* Complete TV-like coverage, with six camera angles you're always right there
  where the action is.
* Play to  a packed stadium complete with cheering crowd and organist. (Bring
  your own peanuts and hotdogs.)
* The most exciting baseball ever on the 2600 with depth and feel you've
  seen on Big League Home Computers.

                              INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO BEGIN:
1.   With power off, insert your Pete Rose Baseball cartridge into your
     Atari 2600 game system according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2.   Plug joystick into left controller for controlling the home team.
     If two players, plug additional joystick into right controller for
     controlling the visiting team.
3.   Turn power on.
4.   Press RESET to begin a one player game. (At any point during the game,
     simply press RESET to start again).

PLAY BALL!
Pressing SELECT will bring you to the Pitching/Batting screen to start a 
new game. Then, you'll have the choice of either playing the computer (one
player) or an opponent (two player), which is displayed at the top of the
screen. Repeatedly pressing SELECT will switch between these two modes.
To &quot;Play Ball&quot;, press RESET and the game will begin.

THE SERIES . . .
It's the last game of the World Series. You're in the 9th inning. Bases
loaded. One out. And you're up at bat. What do you do? Swing away? Wait for
a walk? Go for the fences? It's all up to you, just like in real pro ball.
Sure, we'll give you the options. And some tips. Like in pitching. Batting
And fielding. But, it's your call.
There are 6 full-colour, live action screens - just like the ones you see
on TV! The pitching/batting screen, left infield, right infield, leftfield,
centrefield and rightfield.

So, start warming up. Step up to the plate. And take your best swing at 
winning the series!

                            PITCHING, BATTING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excitement on the Mound!

PITCHING:
First, decide whether you want the pitch inside or out. Move the joystick
left or right to position your pitcher on the pitching rubber. Next, use the
joystick to control the velocity of the pitch. Up for fast. Down for slow.

Once you've positioned your pitcher and selected a pitch speed, press the
button to start the wind up and move the joystick up for a fast ball. Down
for a sinker. Left, a screwball. Right, a curveball. Or centre for the 
change-up.

When the pitcher releases the ball, the joystick position will determine 
what pitch is thrown.

Putting the ball in play

BATTING:
To get the ball rolling - or flying, you first have to connect. Use the
joystick to move your player around in the batter's box. You can move the 
batter up or down to swing high, down the middle, or low. You can also move
left or right - for hitting inside and outside pitches.
As you see the pitch coming, you can make split second adjustments - to best
handle the pitch thrown.
As the ball approaches the plate, press the button to swing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            RUNNING, FIELDING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, 2nd, 3rd and home!

RUNNING:
After you hit the ball, you control the runners. All of the forced runners
will advance automatically - if the ball is hit on the ground or bounces
before it's caught. Runners who aren't forced, will rely on your coaching.
There are 4 joystick controls for running:

Joystick Left,  Button Released . . . . . . . . . . . . Advance all runners
Joystick Right, Button Released . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Hold all runners
Joystick Left,  Button Pressed. . . . . . . . . . . . . Advance lead runner
Joystick Right, Button Pressed. . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Hold lead runner

INFIELD FLY RULE:
If a fly ball is hit to the infield, and there are less than 2 outs, and 
first base is occupied -  the runners will not advance and the batter will
be called out.

How to make the plays - and get the outs

FIELDING:
After the ball is hit, you'll see either the left or right infield screen -
depending on the flight of the ball. While the infield screens are displayed,
with the button pressed, you can select a fielder based on the following
joystick positions:

For Left Infield:                       For Right Infield:

Up . . . . . . . . 2nd Base             Up . . . . . . . . 2nd Base
Down . . . . . . .  Catcher             Down . . . . . . .  Catcher
Right. . . . . . .  Pitcher             Right. . . . . . . 1st Base
Left . . . . . . . 3rd Base             Left . . . . . . .  Pitcher

If it's smacked into the outfield, the left, right or centre-field screen
will be displayed.
Once you've guided your fielder to retrieve the ball, with the button 
pressed, use the following joystick controls to throw:

Up . . . . . .  to 2nd Base             Left . . . . .to Third Base
Down . . . . . to Homeplate             Right. . . . . .to 1st Base

The flashing arrows in the baseball diamond at the top of the screen will
remind you of joystick positioning for making throws. Since the infield is
never displayed all at once, the small baseball diamond will inform you of
the current positions of the runners.

* A base note - your infield players can only move up and down within the
following boundaries:

                           TIPS FROM THE PRO'S
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*    To judge a fly ball, chase the ball's shadow - NOT THE BALL ITSELF!
     It'll always land to your advantage - trust me!
*    Remember to watch the flashing arrows in the small baseball diamond
     at the top of your screen, when trying to decide which base you want
     to throw the ball to.
*    Of course, official baseball rules apply . . . 3 strikes, you're out,
     4 balls, take your base. 3 outs, the innings over. And so on.

. . .I hope these tips will give you a better grip on the game - and a great
shot at winning the championship.
Now that we've covered all the bases - get your pro ball career off to a
flying start. Select an opponent. Press reset. And play ball!
