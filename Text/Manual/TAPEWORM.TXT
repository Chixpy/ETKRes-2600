PLAYING THE GAME
	"A Look at the Bean Patch"
	[Screen shot of Tape Worm's play screen.  It looks very much like Atari
Surround, except there are Beans, Beetles, a Spider, a Bird, an Apple and a
Worm.]

When you start the game "SLINKY" and the first bean appear on the screen.

The idea is to eat each of the ten beans (they appear one at a time) before
the mystery beetle moves across the screen from left to right.

If you eat the bean before the beetle gets to the fruit, the beetle moves
back to the left and the bean counter is reduced by one.  If however, the
mystery beetle gets to the fruit first, then 2 additional beans appear on
the screen and the bean counter is increased by 2.

A maximum of 8 beans will appear on the screen at any one time.  And the
bean counter can hold up to 30 beans at a time.

You start the game with 4 chances to eat the fruits.
You lose a chance (worm) if --
1.	You touch the edges of the bean patch.
2.	You get tangled up.
3.	You touch an obstacle in one of the advanced patches.
4.	"SPANKY" or "BEEKY" eats you.

SPANKY AND BEEKY
At any time these guys can appear on the bean patch.  They will only catch
"SLINKY" if they touch his head (yellow square).  So when you see them...Get
out of the way!!

As you advance from patch to patch, different obstacles appear in the middle
of the screen.  If you touch any part of them you lose one chance.

1. Apple Bean Patch
2. Orange Bean Patch
3. Grape Bean Patch (Night)
4. Strawberry Bean Patch
5. Banana Bean Patch

NIGHT PATCH
The third patch is at night.  In order to see the patch you must push the
red button on your joystick.  This will give you approximately 2 seconds of
light.  When you eat a bean you get additional 2 seconds of light.  Each
time you press the fire button, you are penalized 1 bean.  So try to use it
as seldom as possible.
