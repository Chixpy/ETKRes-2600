===============================================================================

You have in your hand one of the most exciting video games every designed.  ONE
WORD OF CAUTION: this games takes a little time to learn because it's so
challenging. It's very tricky.  So please read these directions and give
yourself some practice time.  Then you can aim for the World Record.

DRAGSTER BASICS
===============

 1. Hook up your video game system. Follow manufactuer's instructions.
 2. With power OFF, plug in game cartridge.
 3. Turn power ON. If no picture appears, check connection of your game
    system to TV, then try steps 1-3 again.
 4. Difficulty settings have no effect on the game. (Skill settings on Sears
    TeleGame Video Arcade Systems have no effect.)
 5. Select game with game select switch.
       Game 1: Staright-ahead Dragster, one or two players.
       Game 2: Steerable Dragster, one or two players.
 6. Your Joystick Controller is both the clutch and gear shift for your 
    Dragster; the red button is your gas pedal.  Use left Joystick for the top
    car; right one for bottom car.  Hold Joystick with button in upper left.
 7. To shift gears, CLUTCH by pushing Joystick to the left and SHIFT by letting
    the Joystick spring back to the center.
 8. Give your Dragster gas by pressing the Joystick button.
 9. Your car starts each race in neautral (N). There are four gear positions -
    1,2,3,4 - and you must clutch and shift between each gear. You cannot 
    downshift.
10. Press game reset or push Joystick to the right to start each race.  The
    race starts with a new countdown and both cars in neutral.
11. When the countdown reaches 0, you can start.  If you drop into gear too
    soon, before the end of the countdown, EARLY will appear on the screen and 
    you have to wait for the next race.  You can clutch during the countdown,
    but you cannot drop into 1st until 0.
12. The object of Dragster is to beat your opponent across the screen, or to 
    race against the clock for best time.

WATCH YOUR TACH
===============

The tachometer (tach) shows how fast your engine is turning over.  A dark green
line that starts at the left side of your TV screen for each can and turns red
at about the middle is your tach.  When it turns red, you are in the high power
- but danger!- area.  You'll find that you get your best speed in each gear by
red-lining your tach close to the maximum and you'll learn by experience just 
where that maximum is.  But watch out! If you rev your engine too much, it will
BLOW. So be careful. Once you blow your engine, the race is over for you (your
motor falls out!).

The way to build maximum speed is to quickly clutch shift and accelerate
through all four gears WITH MAXIMUM POWER AT EACH GEAR LEVEL.

Once you start shifting gears, you can''t downshift.  But if you shift too
soon, your engine will lug (work heavily); you will accelerate slowly and lose
some time.  It's tricky and takes practice, but your patience and perserverance
will be rewarded with good times.

WORLD CLASS TIMES
=================

In a one-on-one game, you win if you beat the other player.  If you want to 
become an expert drag racer, you'll want to come in under 6.50 seconds.  And 
if you can do better than 6 seconds, take a picture of the screen and send it
to us.  We'll enroll you in our World Class Dragster Club.  Be sure to send a 
photo of the screen.

READY FOR A BIGGER CHALLENGE?
=============================

Try Game 2.  Not only do you have to clutch and shift your racer quickly
through four gears and give it the gas without blowing your engine, you also
have to STEER YOUR DRAGSTER between the grandstands and the center divider.
You steer by moving your Joystick up and down.  Any time under 6.20 seconds
in Game 2 is sensational.

HOW TO BE A WORLD CLASS DRAGSTER DRIVER
=======================================

(Tips from David Crane, Disigner of Dragster by ACTIVISION.)

(David's Picture goes here) David Crane, a senior member of Activision's 
design team, started computer game playing as a team leader of a college 
project.  David is also the designer of Freeway, Fishing Derby, and Laser
Blast by ACTIVISION. Dave specializes in games that other disigners
consider impossible.

"The key to World Class times in Dragster is training your reflexes to clutch
and shift qucikly, accelerating at maximum power in each gear without blowing
your engine. Call it racing shifting, if you like, but it's the only way you'll
get your speed down under seven seconds."

"There are a couple of tricks that are not so obvious, For example, put the
clutch in during the last numbers of the countdown, hold it in, rev up
(careful) and pop the clutch by letting go of the Joystick the instant the
screen reads 0."

"Then you should try to rev your engine to KEEP THE TACH IN THE RED AS YOU GO
THROUGH ALL FOUR GEARS (without blowing your engine). You've got to keep your
revs up for speed."

"If you drop out of the red in any gear (and particularly in third or forth),
try tapping the Joystick quickly to the left a few times ("popping the clutch")
to get added acceleration."

"Do a wheelie? Sure, go ahead. When your front wheels come up off the road, 
you're getting maximum acceleration. But watch out! Push the gas too hard and
you'll blow!"

"I had great fun doing Dragster.  Hope you enjoy it.  Write and let me know how
you do. And if you break 6.00 seconds, take a photo of the screen and send it 
to us.  So far the World Record is 5.61 seconds. If you break that, it will
make news!"

Ed Note: Dragster was the 1st game from activision in a long line of games for
the 2600.  This company was one of the best in its day and I loved every game
they put out.  Allthough I couldn't afford them all then, I am now actively
seeking the complete activision games in the box with instrcutions. -Dean
