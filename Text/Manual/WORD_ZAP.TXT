WORD ZAPPER

Word Zapper is a one or two-player, full color, action game with 24
variations, designed to be played on the ATARI (R) Video Computer
System (TM) or Sears Video Arcade.

The Joystick Controller links you with a most profound vehicle of
amusement, the rotary wing Word Zapper. It is armed with vertical and
horizontal firing lasers and capable of incredible maneuverability.

Opposing you is the Scroll -- a diabolic device designed to wear out
the wrist an boggle the mind. The Scroll parades the alphabet across
the screen, taunting you to duplicate a word or scrambled letters
flashed at the bottom of the screen.

You must shoot each letter in perfect order, and you must match three
words or letter combinations within 99 seconds.

Sounds easy? Wait until you meet the Scroll's friend, the Asteroids.

SCORING

The game ends when (a) you shoot down all three words, or (b) you are
struck by a Doomsday asteroid, or (c) you run out of time. When any of
these occurs, the Zapper will land and your score will be displayed.
The level you obtain will be based on how many words you shoot down.

        NUMBER OF WORDS         LEVEL
               0                Rookie
               1                Champ
               2                Ace
               3                Zapper (Honorary Rank)

Of course, the time remaining will be zero unless you are able to get
all three words in less than 99 seconds (thus obtaining the Honorary
Rank of Zapper).

When playing a two-player game, Player One uses the Left Joystick
control and plays until his game ends. Player Two then plays using the
Right Joystick control until his game ends. Both scores and levels will
then be displayed.


PLAYING THE GAME

1.  When the game begins, a word or scrambled letters appear at the
    bottom of the screen. You MUST remember them! They will disappear in
    four seconds. When they disappear, the Zapper will be activated and
    the alphabet will begin to scroll across the top of the screen. You
    must shoot scrolling letters in the exact order found in the word or
    scrambled letters.
2.  To shoot the scrolling letters, depress the Red Fire Button on the
    Joystick. This fires the letter laser.
3.  There are four different types of asteroids that may hit the Zapper.
    When the power is turned on, all four will parade across the screen.
    From top to bottom, these are:

      DOOMSDAY  --If a Doomsday asteroid hits the Zapper, the game is
                  all over. You can identify this asteroid by the
                  distinctively dangerous noise it makes as it approaches
                  the Zapper. For an easier game, this asteroid may be
                  turned off with the Right Difficulty Switch. (See Game
                  Selection.)
      SCROLLER  --If a Scroller asteroid hits the Zapper, the scrolling
                  letters are mixed up for five seconds. For an easier
                  game, this asteroid may be turned off with the Left
                  Difficulty Switch. (See Game Selection.)
      BONKER    --If a Bonker asteroid hits the Zapper, it BONKS it to
                  the side.
      ZONKER    --If a Zonker asteroid hits the Zapper, it ZONKS it to
                  the side.

4.  The Zapper can also shoot asteroids. Holding down the Red Fire Button
    while moving the Joystick to either side causes the Zapper to fire in
    that direction.
5.  If you shoot down five asteroids, you get a "Freebie." A Freebie can
    substitute for any letter, but if you use it you must shoot five more
    asteroids. A "Freebie" MUST be shot to complete a word and advance
    to a new word.
