Kung-Fu Master

For the Atari 2600 and Compatible Systems

Martial Artists Guide

Activision


One Goal, Many Levels
---------------------
The lovely Princess Victoria is being held captive in the Evil Wizard's temple.
As the Kung-Fu Master, you're the only one powerful enough to rescue her.

The temple itself wouldn't pose that much of a problem.  Except that it has
five different levels.  And each one is crawling with a tireless army of
enemies.

Using your superb martial arts skills, you'll have to oust henchmen, knife-
throwers, dragons, and a slew of other not-very-nice types.

If you manage to clean out everybody on a level, you'll automatically go to
the next level.  And your energy meter and timer will be reset.

Once you succeed in rescuing Princess Victoria, you'll be sent back down to
the first floor for more kicking and punching and jumping.  Only this time
things will happen even faster and more furiously.

Start-Up
--------
1. Make sure that the power switch on your game machine is OFF.

2. Insert the Kung-Fu Master cartridge as described in you game system owner's
   guide.

3. Turn the power switch to ON.

4. To begin play for a 1-player game, press the GAME RESET lever.  To begin
   play for a 2-player game, press the GAME SELECT lever, then the GAME RESET
   lever.

What's on the Screen
--------------------
In the upper left quarter of the screen you'll notice some numbers and bars.
Here's what's what:

  Timer
  -----
  The first number-the one that keeps getting smaller-is your timer.  When it
  reaches 200, a warning will sound to let you know that time's running out.
  And when the timer reaches zero, you lose your life.

  Lives
  -----
  The number off to the right a bit (it starts at 3) is the number of lives
  you have left.

  Score
  -----
  The lower numbe-the one that keeps increasing (you hope)-is your score.  You
  can earn points for destroying each opponent-unless you let him get too
  close before you punch or kick him.

  Your Energy Bar
  ---------------
  The first bar, labeled PLAYER, indicates your energy level.  When it runs
  out, so does your life.

  Enemy Energy Bar
  ----------------
  The second bar, labeled ENEMY, is the energy meter for the final opponent in
  each level.  You must deplete all of his energy to be able to go on to the
  next level.

Note on two-player games:  In a two player game, play alternates whenever a
player loses a life.  The second-player's timer, score, and energy bar replace
thos of the first player, and so on.  If one player loses all of his lives,
the other player continues without interruption until the game is over.

One Friend, Many Enemies
------------------------
Princess Victoria is your only friend in this treacherous temple.  Everyone
else-and everything else-is out to get you.  Some of your enemies demonstrate
their power in numbers.  Others sport some nasty weapons.  While still others-
like the snakes-are completely indestructible.

You'll quickly learn the ins and outs of doing in your various opponents.
Each type requires special handling.  Here's a hint or two on how to handle
them, just to get you started.

Henchmen.  They're not that much of a threat for a Kung-Fu Master like you.
One punch or kick should do it.  Problem is, there's so many of them.  And
they come at you from both sides.  Plus, they'll try to hold on to you and
drain your energy.

Knife-throwers.  Duck or jump to avoid the knives.  And use two punches or
kicks to knock these guys out of the game.

Midgets.  These tumbling attackers approach you from either side.  Sometimes
it's best toget them with a low punch or kick.

Dragon balls.  Inside each of these innocent-looking falling balls is a fire-
breathing dragon, just waiting to singe your ghi off.  Destroy the ball before
it hits the ground using a single kick.  Or duke it out with the dragon with
punches or kicks.

Snake baskets.  Like the dragons, these vile creatures fall from the sky
disguised.  Only these guys are hidden in baskets.  Smash the baskets before
they hit the ground.  Or stay away from the scurrying snakes inside.  Best to
jump over them if you have to.

Killer moths.  They'll fly around annoyingly, trying to sting you.  Sting them
first will a well-placed punch or kick.

The Five Biggies.  At the end of each level there's one guy who's bigger and
badder than all the others.  He can't exactly kill you with one blow, but each
of his hits will put a big dent in your energy level.  So if your energy is
already low when you meet him, you could be in big trouble.

Here's who's who on each level:
    Level 1 - The Fist Fighter
    Level 2 - The Boomerang Thrower
    Level 3 - The Giant Kicker
    Level 4 - The Lightning Magician
    Level 5 - The Gang Master

Total Control
-------------
As an experienced Kung-Fu master, you have total control of your every move,
every punch, every kick.  The key is knowing when and where to use each
element of your martial artistry.  The following instructions outline precisely
what you need to do to execute each move:

To move right or left, move the joystick right or left.

To jump, push the joystick forward.

To squat, pull the joystick back.

To kick high, move the joystick to the right or left and press the button.

To kick low, pull the joystick back and press the button.

To punch high, push the joystick diagonally forward to the right or left and
press the button.

To punch low, pull the joystick diagonally back to the right or left and press
the button.

To break a Henchman's hold, jiggle the joystick rapidly from side to side.

Earning Points and Extra Lives
------------------------------
You'll earn points for defeating your enemies.  Some enemies are worth more
points than others.

Any time left over at the end of a level is multiplied by 10 and added to your
score.  And any energy left over at the end of a level is multiplied by 100
and added to your score.

Here's what earns what:

  ENEMY                    POINTS     POINTS
                             PER        PER
                            KICK       PUNCH
  --------------------     ------     ------
  Henchmen                   100        100
  Knife Thrower              500        800
  Midgets                    200        300
  Dragon Ball               2000       2000
  Killer Moths               500        600
  Fist Fighter              2000       2000
  Boomerang Thrower         3000       3000
  Giant Kicker              3000       3000
  Lightning Magician        5000       5000
  Gang Master              10000      10000

New Lives
---------
You'll be awarded an extra life at 75,000 points.

A Few Hints
-----------
   * Don't use punches and kicks randomly.  A true martial artist knows when
     to apply them at just the right moment.

   * Try to figure out which type of blow works best against which opponents.
     Most of them have certain weak spots.

   * Don't try to battle the snake-just stay out of its way.

   * Remember: no one opponent can kill you outright.  But they all rob you
     of energy.  So if an opponent happens to hit you just when your energy
     is low enough, he may end up killing you.

   * Keep a close eye on the timer.  When it runs out, so does your life.
