<p align="center"><big><strong>1. NOTE TO PARENTS </strong></big></p>

<p>MATH GRAN PRIX is an educational game for children, ages 6 through 10. By solving
arithmetic problems shown on the screen, players move their cars along the Gran Prix
track. While the game is designed to exercise and strengthen basic arithmetic skills, it
also offers children an element of chance and surprise that will capture their attention
and enthusiasm. </p>

<p>In addition to nine different game versions, MATH GRAN PRIX contains a built-in
&quot;tutor&quot; to encourage players of all skill levels. The computer will respond to
incorrect answers by offering progressively easier problems. The problems become more
difficult in response to correct answers. This helps to balance the different abilities of
two players, and insures a more exciting race for each game. </p>

<p>Part of arithmetic reasoning is learning to find different and quicker ways to solve
problems. To enhance this goal, each player has the option of playing MATH GRAN PRIX with
a time limit on each problem. A more advanced player may choose to play with a time limit,
while the other player plays without. </p>

<p>We suggest that you read through this manual once with your children; then put them
behind the wheel. MATH GRAN PRIX will keep them playing and practicing long after they've
set down their books and worksheets. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>2. GAME PLAY </strong></big></p>

<p>The object of the game is to cross the finish line before the other car. For each turn,
the computer gives you an arithmetic problem. When you answer the problem correctly, your
car zooms further ahead. If your answer is wrong, the computer gives you the correct
answer and your car stays where it is. Players take turns with each other or, in a
one-player game, with the computer. </p>

<p>At the beginning of each turn, you will be given a choice of moving <strong>2 OR 3
SPACES</strong>. If this message appears in red, the red car moves; if it is blue, the
blue car moves. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are not using a color television, red will appear black;
blue will appear white. </p>

<p>If you choose to move two instead of three spaces, the computer will give you a
slightly easier problem to answer. But as you will see, there are other reasons you may
only want to move two spaces. </p>

<p><strong>BUMPING</strong> </p>

<p>For example, you may want to bump the other car off the track. When this happens, the
bumped car breaks down on the side of the road. The computer will automatically give the
driver a two-space problem. The correct answer will fix the car. The car is not actually
back in the race until the next turn. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Cars cannot bump each other until after the first track
crossing. Also, all crossings are safe spots. (See Figure 1.) </p>

<p><strong>TRACK MARKERS </strong></p>

<p>Other spots you'll want to head for are the Gran Prix track markers. </p>

<pre>        XXXX

        XXXX
    XXXXXXXXXXXX

  <em>    (Spinner)</em></pre>

<p>The Spinner will shoot you ahead one to four spaces. </p>

<pre>    XXXX    XXXX
        XXXX
        XXXX
    XXXX    XXXX

      <em>(Skipper)</em></pre>

<p>The Skipper gives you an extra turn. Watch for the 2 OR 3 SPACES message in your racing
color. </p>

<pre>        XXXX
    XXXXXXXXXXXX
    XXXX    XXXX
    XXXX    XXXX

      <em>(Sinker)</em></pre>

<p>The Sinker protects you from being bumped off the track. The other car will seem to
cover you, but you'll race off without a dent. </p>

<pre>           XXXX
       XXXX
   XXXX

      <em>(Steps)</em></pre>

<p>The Steps is the last track marker before the finish line. If your car lands here, the
computer will give you only three-space problems until your car or the other car makes it
across the finish line. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>3. USING THE CONTROLLERS </strong></big></p>

<p>Use your Joystick Controller with this ATARI Game Program cartridge. Be sure the
controller cables are firmly plugged into the <strong>CONTROLLER</strong> jacks at the
back of your ATARI Video Computer System game. For one-player games, plug your Joystick
Controller into the <strong>LEFT CONTROLLER</strong> jack. Hold the controller with the
red button to your upper left, toward the television screen. <em>See Section 3 of your
owner's manual for further details. </em></p>

<p>Use your controller to choose a two or a three-space problem. Move your Joystick to
left for a two-space problem; move it to the right if you want to try for three spaces.
Press the red fire button when you are ready for the problem. </p>

<p>Your Joystick also lets you &quot;write&quot; your answer on the screen. Pushing the
Joystick forward lets you count up from O to 9; pulling it toward you lets you count down
from 9 to 0. The number you choose will appear above the &quot;cursor,&quot; or little
dash, in the answer space. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>              9-0
               ^
               |
               |
   Cursor &lt;--- O ---&gt; Cursor
    Left       |      Right
               |
               v
              0-9


      2   &lt;--- O ---&gt;   3
   Spaces             Spaces</pre>

<p>As you will see, the Joystick will only count up to <strong>9</strong>. So, if your
answer is <strong>10</strong> or more, do this: Write a 1; move the Joystick to the right
to move the cursor over; then write a <strong>0</strong>. Press the fire button when you
have chosen your answer. DO NOT PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON UNTIL YOU HAVE WRITTEN IN ALL THE
NUMBERS IN YOUR ANSWER. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Moving the cursor to the left will automatically erase the
number above it. You may move the cursor back and forth and change your answer as many
times as you like before pressing the red fire button. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>4. CONSOLE CONTROLS </strong></big></p>

<p><strong>GAME SELECT/GAME RESET SWITCHES</strong> </p>

<p>Use <strong>GAME SELECT </strong>to choose the game of MATH GRAN PRIX you want to play.
When you press <strong>GAME SELECT</strong>, two numbers will appear on your screen: the
game number on the left, and the number of players on the right (see Figure 3). Press <strong>GAME
SELECT </strong>until the numbers you want appear; then press <strong>GAME RESET </strong>to
start the game. </p>

<p>Both switches will stop the game at any time. <strong>GAME RESET </strong>will start
the same game over; <strong>GAME SELECT </strong>will let you choose a new game. </p>

<p><strong>DIFFICULTY SWITCHES </strong></p>

<p>To play MATH GRAN PRIX with a time limit, set your <strong>DIFFICULTY </strong>switch
to the <strong>A </strong>position. This will give you a one-minute time limit on all
addition and subtraction problems, and a two-minute limit on multiplication and division
problems. If you do not answer a problem in time, the computer writes in the correct
answer and your car stays where it is. </p>

<p>To play the game without a time limit, set your <strong>DIFFICULTY </strong>switch to
the <strong>B </strong>position. </p>

<p>The player using the left Joystick Controller uses the <strong>LEFT </strong>DIFFICULTY
switch; the player with the right Joystick Controller uses the <strong>RIGHT DIFFICULTY </strong>switch.
</p>

<p><strong>TV TYPE SWITCH </strong></p>

<p>Set this switch to <strong>COLOR </strong>if you have a color television set. Set it to
<strong>B-W </strong>to play the game in black and white. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>5. GAME VARIATIONS </strong></big></p>

<p>MATH GRAN PRIX has nine game versions. <strong>Games 1, 2 </strong>and <strong>3 </strong>contain
only addition and subtraction problems; <strong>Games 4, 5 </strong>and <strong>6 </strong>contain
only multiplication and division problems. <strong>Games 7, 8 </strong>and <strong>9 </strong>contain
all four types of arithmetic problems. </p>

<p>Each of these three game groups has an easy, medium and hard difficulty level. So, in
the first group, <strong>Game 1</strong> is the easiest and <strong>Game 3 </strong>the
hardest. See the <strong>GAME SELECT MATRIX </strong><em>for a breakdown of all the games</em>.
</p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>6. HELPFUL HINTS </strong></big></p>

<p>Answering the problems alone will not always win the race for you. As you will notice,
in a one-player game, the computer always hits the track markers and always tries to bump
you off the track. </p>

<p>Like the computer, you'll want to head for the track markers. And use the safe spots.
You'll have to think a few moves ahead to stay in the race.</p>
