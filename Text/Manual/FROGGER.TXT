Leapin' Frogger! Home may look like it's only a hop,
skip, and a jump away, but looks can be deceiving, First
there's a dangerous highway to hop across, full of fast-
moving cars and trucks. Then there's a swirling river to
leap, full of frog-eating creatures. How's Frogger going to
get home safely! By letting you hop him on his way.
Guide Frogger safely through this perilous journey, and
you'll jump for joy!

OBJECT
======
The object of the game is to hop as many frogs to safety
as you can-and to score the most points along the way!

SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS
============================
1. To select a game number (see Game Selection Box),
   press down on the GAME SELECT switch. The game
   number will appear at the top of the screen.

2. Set the DIFFICULTY switch:
   Position A:
   You'll lose Frogger if he's carried off-screen on a 
   floating object.
   Position B:
   Frogger can be carried safely off-screen on a floating
   object. He'll then reappear on the other side of the
   screen so you can continue play. However, Frogger
   can't *hop* off-screen.

In a one-player game, use the left DIFFICULTY switch.
In a two-player game, the 1st player uses the left DIFFI-
CULTY switch and the 2nd player uses the right DIFFI-
CULTY switch.

3. Press down the GAME RESET switch---and you're
   ready to start the action!

THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLERS
========================
Make sure you plug the Joystick controllers firmly into
the jacks at the back of your video system. Use the LEFT
controller jack for one-player games.
                                                  ^ Forward
Use the Joystick to jump Frogger              _   |

In games 1-4, move the Joystick              | |
*once* in the direction you wish            _| |_
Frogger to jump. Frogger will make         |o| | |
one *jump* in that direction. You *must*   | | | |
do this each time you want Frogger         |     |
to make one jump. In games 5 and           |_____|
6, Frogger becomes "Speedy"                |     |
Frogger! As long as you *hold* the         \_____/
Joystick in one direction, Speedy
Frogger will jump again and again                <->
in that direction.                       Left, Right

       -----------------------------Remaining Frogs

You'll start the game with 5 frogs. The first frog is shown
on the sidewalk below the traffic. The remaining frogs are
shown as white squares on the lower left-hand corner of
the screen.

TIME BAND
=========
You have only 30 seconds to move Frogger from the
sidewalk and into a home bay, one of the blue, open-
ended squares at the top of the screen.

Time is monitored by the time band, the black line
located in the lower right-hand corner of the screen.
When you have only 5 seconds left to get Frogger into a
home bay, you'll hear a warning sound and see the line
turn red.

FROM SIDEWALK TO RIVERBANK
==========================
Frogger starts his perilous journey on the sidewalk, fac-
ing 5 lanes of cars and trucks. When the music stops,
you're ready to start Frogger hopping!

Try to get Frogger through the lanes of traffic. Traffic trav-
els in alternating directions and at different speeds, so be
careful! Frogger will get "splooched" if he touches any
part of a vehicle or is run over!

FROM RIVERBANK TO RIVER
=======================
Because Frogger can't swim in the river (the current is
too strong), hop him from one row of logs, turtles, or alli-
gators onto the next in order to cross it.


     #   ###   ###   ###   ###   #  1. Logs(%%%): Frogger can
     #%%%%%         %%%%%        #  hop from side to
     #          @ @        @ @   #  side on a log; he
     # %%%%%O%%%%%               #  can also jump for-
     #      %%%   %%%   %%%      #  ward and backward
     #       @ @ @          @ @ @#  onto another float-
     #___________________________#  object. But he'll
     #    ****           ****    #  land in the river if
     #      **             **    #  he leaps to the left
     #    **  **              ** #  or right off a log.
     #     **  **              **#
     #        **              ** #
     #___________________________#
     #ooo                    ====#


2. Turtles(@): The red circles that float on the river are the
   turtles. Frogger is safe on their backs as well as in the
   water area between a set of them (2 or 3 turtles in a
   row). He can jump forward and backward from a turtle
   onto another floating object. But he'll land in the river if
   he jumps to the left or right off either of the end turtles.


     #   ###   ###   ###   ###   #  3. Diving Turtles:
     #%%%%%         %%%%%        #  These tricky turtles
     #          @ O        @ @   #  can float on the
     # %%%%%%%%%%%               #  water and dive
     #      %%%   %%%   %%%      #  under the water!
     #       @ @ @          @ @ @#  When they're red,
     #___________________________#  it's safe for Frogger
     #    ****           ****    #  to jump on their
     #      **             **    #  backs. But once
     #    **  **              ** #  they turn light blue,
     #     **  **              **#  watch out! That
     #        **              ** #
     #___________________________#
     #ooo                    ====#

   means they're getting ready to dive, so hop Frogger
   onto another floating object fast! If you're not quick
   enough, Frogger will get "splooched."

   But these turtles can't stay underwater forever. When
   you see a set of light blue turtles suddenly appear on
   the screen, this means they're coming up for air.
   they'll soon be changing from light blue to red, so
   Frogger will be safe on their backs until they dive
   again.

While crossing the river, here are some other things to
watch for:

1. Lady-Frog: Occasionally you'll see a white "lady" frog
   hopping frantically along a log. If you hop Frogger onto
   the log to rescue her and take her home, you'll score
   bonus points. Just hop Frogger close enough to here so
   she'll jump onto his back. You'll hear a high-pitched
   sound when she does. Now, try to get Frogger---and
   the lady frog---home to safety.


     #   ###   ###   ###   ###   #  2. Alligators(=%%%<): Alligators
     #%%%%%         =%%%<        #     swim among the logs
     #          @ @        @ @   #     from time to time.
     # %%%%%%%%%%%               #     You'll see them
     #      o%%   %%%   %%%      #     snapping their jaws
     #       @ O @          @ @ @#     open and closed,
     #___________________________#     just waiting for a
     #    ****           ****    #     tender Frogger mor-
     #      **             **    #     sel to jump their
     #    **  **              ** #     way! Frogger is safe
     #     **  **              **#     on an alligator's tail
     #        **              ** #
     #___________________________#
     #ooo                    ====#

   and back. But Frogger is a goner if he jumps into
   its jaws!



3. Floating Off-Screen: Frogger get "splooched" in
   DIFFICULTY Position A if he's carried off-screen on a
   log, turtle, or alligator. This *doesn't* happen if DIFFI-
   CULTY Position B.


     #   ###   ###   ###   ###   #  4. Snakes(--=): Snakes
     #%%%%%         %%%%%        #     will appear on the

     #       @ @ @          @ @ @#     can hop Frogger

     #      **             **    #     "splooched" if he
     #    **  **              ** #     hops too close to a
     #     **  **              **#     snake's mouth!
     #        **              ** #
     #___________________________#
     #ooo                    ====#


FROM RIVER TO HOME BAY
======================
Successfully hop Frogger into a home bay, and he's
safe and sound! You'll score points each time you bring
Frogger home, and get bonus points each time you
bring 5 frogs home!

When leaping Frogger into its home bay, here are some
things to watch for:

1. Jumping Home: Hop Frogger into a home bay when
   he's *directly* in front of it. If Frogger hits any part of the
   green shrubbery on the sides of the home bay, he'll
   land in the river.

2. Occupied Home Bay: Frogger can't jump into a home
   bay that's occupied by another frog.


     #   ### < ###   ### & ###   #  3. Alligator's Head(<):
     #%%%%%         %%O%%        #     If an alligator's
     #          @ @        @ @   #     head is showing in

     #      %%%   %%%   %%%      #     safe for Frogger to
     #       @ @ @          @ @ @#     jump in. However,

     #      **             **    #     face, Frogger won't
     #    **  **              ** #     be harmed.
     #     **  **              **#
     #        **              ** #
     #___________________________#
     #ooo                    ====#


4. Fly(&): If you hop Frogger into a home bay while a fly is
   showing, Frogger gets a free meal---and you score
   extra points!

GAME DIFFICULTY
===============
Each time you bring 5 frogs home, you'll hear a short
tune. Then the game will continue at a more difficult
game level with your remaining frogs. The traffic will be
more difficult to cross. There will be fewer floating objects
on the river, and the speed of these floating objects will
vary from fast to slow. Frogger-eating snakes will also
appear on the riverbank and, in progressively more
difficult levels, on the logs.

END OF GAME
===========
The game ends when no frogs are left.

To Play Again: In a one-player game, press the red but-
ton on your Joystick to play again at the same game
number. In a two-player game, both players press the red
buttons at the same time to play again at the same game
number. To play at another game number, use the GAME
SELECT switch.

GAME VARIATIONS
===============
Frogger has 6 game variations. Games 1, 3, and 5 are
one-player games; 2, 4, and 6 are two-player games. See
the Game Selection Box for game number variations.

Two-Player Games: Games 2, 4, and 6 are two-player
games. The left player goes first; players then alternate
turns. Your turn ends when you lose a frog; you begin
your turn again with your remaining frogs. Each player's
score is displayed throughout his or her turn at the top
of the screen. The game ends once both players have
lost all their frogs.

SCORING
=======
Your score is displayed at the top of the screen through-
out the game. Points accumulate as follows:

Successfully jumping Frogger forward......1 point
Successfully jumping Frogger home.........5 points
Successfully jumping 5 frogs home.......100 points
Taking a lady frog home..................20 points
Eating a fly.............................20 points
Extra points for time left................2 points
                              per remaining second

Every time you score 1,000 points and have fewer than
4 frogs left, you'll get another Frogger! When this
happens, you'll see another white square on the lower
left-hand corner of the screen.
