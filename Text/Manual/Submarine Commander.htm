<p align="center"><big><strong>1. INTRODUCTION </strong></big></p>

<p>Just imagine that you are the captain of a ship, and it's your job to protect your
country. Your modern submarine is equipped with many new features to help you. The control
panel includes a radar scope, a sonar depth charge detector, status indicators, a fuel
readout, an engine temperature gauge, and of course, torpedoes. </p>

<p>Since you're the commander, you are at the helm. It's up to you to guide the submarine.
You'll use your periscope to scan the ocean and detect enemy vessels. When you spot the
enemy, launch a </p>

<p>torpedo. Destroy their ships before they destroy your submarine. Be on the the lookout
for dangerous depth charge attacks. A depth charge hit could mean serious damage to your
submarine. </p>

<p>Your submarine is equipped with limited supplies, especially fuel. Keep a constant
watch on your fuel and energy levels. Every maneuver costs you fuel. When the fuel runs
out, your mission is over. </p>

<p>We know you can handle the job, so good luck Commander! </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>2. OBJECT OF THE GAME </strong></big></p>

<p>The object of the game is to sink as many enemy ships as possible. As you sink ships,
you score points. Some of the ships can drop depth charges, which might damage your
submarine (see <strong>GAME VARIATIONS</strong>, <em>Section 5</em>). </p>

<p>Depth charges are indicated on the depth charge detector gauge. The gauge alerts you to
the closeness and the seriousness of a depth charge. Because your sub is equipped with
sonar detection you can identify the location of enemy ships before they are sighted
through the periscope. This allows you to shoot a torpedo before the enemy drops a depth
charge. </p>

<p>Your sub also carries 3000 units of fuel and two torpedo launchers. The fuel level is
proportional to the engine temperature. Watch the engine temperature gauge at the top
center of the screen, as shown </p>

<p>in Figure 1. The more maneuvers you make, the hotter the engine gets. Every torpedo
launched uses three units of fuel, but every depth charge hit costs 300-377 units of fuel.
Some fuel is also used just to run the submarine engines. When all the fuel runs out, the
temperature gauge turns black, and the game is over. </p>

<p><strong>GAUGES</strong> </p>

<p>Each gauge on the control panel serves a specific function. With time and practice,
you'll be able to use all of the gauges to your best advantage. (See <strong>HELPFUL HINTS</strong>,
<em>Section 7</em>.) </p>

<p><strong>FUEL GAUGE </strong></p>

<p>The fuel gauge at the bottom, center of the screen starts with 3000 units of fuel and
counts backwards until you run out of fuel. </p>

<p><strong>TORPEDO STATUS GAUGE </strong></p>

<p>Torpedo status gauges are located at the bottom of the screen, directly above the fuel
gauge. The gauge is green when a torpedo is ready to launch. Press the fire button and a
torpedo launches from the side with the green light. (See Figure I for torpedo status
gauge.) If a torpedo tube is damaged by a depth charge, it becomes black and wilt not work
for the rest of the game. </p>

<p><strong>ENGINE TEMPERATURE GAUGE </strong></p>

<p>Engine temperature is indicated at the top, center of the screen. As the engine gets
hot, the gauge turns red. The hotter the engine, the more fuel it consumes. If the gauge
turns yellow, the engine has been damaged and is running at half speed. </p>

<p><strong>DIRECTIONAL GAUGE </strong></p>

<p>This is the broken black line located below the engine temperature gauge. When you move
the sub right or left, the lines move right or left, as though you are steering the
submarine. </p>

<p><strong>SONAR DETECTOR </strong></p>

<p>The sonar detector, located at the bottom, left side of the screen, identifies the
location of an enemy ship before it is visible on the screen. When this device turns red,
it is indicating the depth and the location of any enemy ship. (See Figure 2 for sonar
detection.) </p>

<p><strong>DEPTH CHARGE DETECTOR </strong></p>

<p>The depth charge detector is an arrow which appears at the lower right corner of the
screen. It points to where a depth charge is located in the water (see Figure 2). If the
arrow is white, it is not dangerously close and you can move your sub in the opposite
direction to avoid a hit. If the arrow is red, look out! You're about to be hit unless you
quickly move away in the opposite direction. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>3. USING THE CONTROLLERS </strong></big></p>

<p>Use your Joystick Controllers with this Tele-Games Cartridge. Be sure the Joystick
Controller cables are firmly plugged into the <strong>CONTROLLER</strong> jacks at the
back of your Video Arcade. For one-player games, use the Joystick Controller plugged into
the <strong>LEFT CONTROLLER</strong> jack. Hold the Joystick with the red button to your
upper left, toward the television screen. <em>See your owner's manual for further details.
</em></p>

<p>Use the Joystick to view the sea and to move your submarine right and left. What you
see on the screen is your view through a periscope. Moving the Joystick up and down
(forward and backward) allows you to see close up or far away to the horizon. (See Figure
3 for Joystick directions.) You can also use the Joystick to maneuver the sub right and
left. This will help you catch up to an enemy ship or move away from a dangerous depth
charge. The direction in which you move your sub is indicated by the broken black line,
just below the temperature gauge. When you move the Joystick right, </p>

<p>the black lines move right indicating that the sub is moving right. When you move the
Joystick left, the black lines move left and your sub is moving left. When your sub is
moving right or left, any torpedoes launched will travel with a slight curve in the
opposite direction. </p>

<p>To shoot a torpedo, press the red fire button. The torpedoes launch from the side where
the torpedo status indicator (see Figure 1) is green. The torpedo launcher changes sides
with every other launch. You will see the green light change sides each time you launch a
torpedo. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>4. CONSOLE CONTROLS </strong></big></p>

<p><strong>GAME SELECT SWITCH </strong></p>

<p>Press down the <strong>GAME SELECT </strong>switch to choose a SUBMARINE COMMANDER game
variation. (See the <strong>GAME SELECT MATRIX</strong>, <em>Section 8 to choose the game
you wish to play</em>.) The game number appears at the top center of the screen, as shown
in Figure 4. </p>

<p><strong>GAME RESET SWITCH</strong></p>

<p>When you have selected the game number you wish to play, press game <strong>RESET </strong>to
start the action. (Pressing the red fire button on the Joystick also starts the game.)
After game <strong>RESET </strong>is pressed, the game number disappears and the score
appears at the top center of the screen, as shown in Figure 5. </p>

<p><strong>PLAYER SKILL SWITCHES </strong></p>

<p>SUBMARINE COMMANDER has two skill levels, <strong>A-EXPERT</strong> and <strong>B-NOVICE</strong>.
The <strong>NOVICE </strong>level is for the beginning player. The <strong>EXPERT </strong>level
is more challenging because every time your sub is hit by a depth charge, you incur damage
which could cause the loss of one of your gauges. </p>

<p>For one-player games, use the <strong>LEFT PLAYER SKILL </strong>switch. For two-player
games, the player using the left controller uses the <strong>LEFT PLAYER SKILL </strong>switch;
the player using the right controller uses the <strong>RIGHT PLAYER SKILL </strong>switch.
The left player starts the game in two-player games. </p>

<p><strong>TV TYPE SWITCH </strong></p>

<p>Set this switch to <strong>COLOR </strong>if your television set is color. Set it to <strong>B/W
</strong>if you are playing the game in black and white. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>5. GAME VARIATIONS </strong></big></p>

<p>SUBMARINE COMMANDER includes 8 game variations (see <strong>GAME SELECT MATRIX</strong>,
<em>Section 8</em>). All odd-numbered games are for one player; all even numbers are
two-player games. </p>

<p><strong>Games 1 </strong>and <strong>2 </strong>are the easiest SUBMARINE COMMANDER
games. In these two variations, the enemy ships do not shoot depth charges. All you have
to do is shoot torpedoes to sink the enemy ships before you run out of fuel. </p>

<p>In <strong>Games 3 </strong>and <strong>4</strong>, only the destroyers attack with
depth charges. </p>

<p>In <strong>Games 5 </strong>and <strong>6</strong>, you will have to avoid the depth
charges of both destroyers and PT boats. </p>

<p><strong>Games 7 </strong>and <strong>8 </strong>are the toughest. You will be dodging
depth charges from destroyers, PT boats, and tankers. </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>6. SCORING </strong></big></p>

<p>You score points when you sink a ship. There are three types of enemy ships in
SUBMARINE COMMANDER, and each scores a different point value, as shown below:</p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="1" width="70%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">TANKER</td>
    <td width="50%">20 POINTS<br>
    Two hits to go down</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">DESTROYER</td>
    <td width="50%">15 POINTS<br>
    One hit to go down</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">PT BOAT</td>
    <td width="50%">35 POINTS<br>
    One hit to go down</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p>If a ship is on the horizon, in which case it appears to be half its normal size, and
you can see the blue sky in the background, the scoring is as follows: </p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="1" width="70%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">TANKER</td>
    <td width="50%">30 POINTS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">DESTROYER</td>
    <td width="50%">25 POINTS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">PT BOAT</td>
    <td width="50%">45 POINTS</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p>The game ends when the fuel level reaches <strong>0 </strong>(zero). In one-player
games, try to beat your highest score. In two-player games, each player tries to beat the
opponent's score. After a two-player game is over, the left player's score appears at the
top, center of the screen; the right player's score appears at the bottom center of the
screen (where the fuel amount was indicated during game play). </p>

<p align="center"><big><strong>7. HELPFUL HINTS </strong></big></p>

<ol>
  <li>Your submarine is equipped with many gauges, each of which is equally important. To
    learn to scan all of the gauges during game play, it is best to master one gauge at a
    time. When you learn one, add another gauge. With lots of practice, you will soon be using
    all of the gauges. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Learn to detect the sounds of the PT boats. If you listen, you can hear them coming just
    before you see them on the screen. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Try to sink as many PT boats as possible. They are worth the most points, and they only
    need one hit to go down. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The easiest position to shoot from is the lowest level on the screen. Pull the Joystick
    back (toward you). When you have mastered ail of the gauges, use the sonar detector and
    move up to the horizon (push the Joystick forward). Ships on the horizon are worth the
    most points, but you are more vulnerable to their depth charges. </li>
</ol>
