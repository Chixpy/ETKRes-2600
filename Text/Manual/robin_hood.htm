ROBIN HOOD<br>
Video Game<br>
<br>
You, &quot;ROBIN HOOD&quot;, are in medieval England trying to right the injustice<br>
of the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. The Sheriff has overtaxed the poor<br>
peasants and hoarded their gold in his castle. He is also keeping the<br>
lovely MAID MARIAN against her will in his castle. Your goal is to save<br>
MAID MARIAN and steal the GOLD so you can return it to the peasants. You<br>
must cross the dangerous Sherwood Forrest where the Sheriff's henchmen<br>
lie in ambush. Then on to the castle gate where again you must fight your<br>
way into the castle. Be sure not to shoot your own Merry Men and watch out,<br>
they occasionally might mistake you for one of the henchmen - fighting<br>
with bows and arrows is dangerous!<br>
<br>
1. OBJECT of the GAME:<br>
<br>
Make your way into the Sheriff of Nottingham's castle and save either<br>
the MAID MARIAN or steal the GOLD so you can give it back to the poor<br>
while collecting as many points as possible before you lose all of your<br>
lives. ROBIN may only carry one of the other prizes back to the Sherwood<br>
Forrest.<br>
<br>
2. CONTROLS:<br>
Press GAME SELECT switch. the left number indicates 1 or 2 player game.<br>
<br>
a) One player game:<br>
Use LEFT JOYSTICK and FIRE BUTTON<br>
<br>
b) Two player game:<br>
Player No. 1:<br>
Use LEFT JOYSTICK and FIRE BUTTON<br>
<br>
Player No. 2:<br>
Use RIGHT JOYSTICK and FIRE BUTTON<br>
<br>
3. SCORE DISPLAY:<br>
<br>
a) The top row of numbers is your score.<br>
<br>
b) The colored bar below the numbered score shows the amount of arrows<br>
ROBIN has left. He starts with 16 arrows for each life. (In a two<br>
player game, players have different colored bars.)<br>
<br>
c) The characters inside this bar show the number of lives ROBIN has left.<br>
<br>
4. SKILL LEVELS:<br>
<br>
Ther are four skill levels in the game. After each successful trip to the<br>
Sheriff's castle, the difficulty automatically increases through three<br>
levels. Players may start on different skill levels by pushing the GAME<br>
SELECT switch. The right number indicates what level the game is on. No. 1<br>
is for novice, No. 2 is for intermediate, and No. 3 is for experienced<br>
players. Also, the A and B difficulty switch allows a fourth level and<br>
provides a handicap feature for the two player game. (A level is for<br>
experienced play and B level is for novice.)<br>
<br>
PLAY ACTION - SCREEN 1<br>
<br>
ATTRACT MODE - GAME SELECT<br>
When you insert ROBIN HOOD end of your Double-Ender(TM) and turn on your<br>
game console, Screen No.1 will appear on your screen. One of the Sheriff's<br>
henchmen will be walking through Sherwood Forrest setting up the ambush of<br>
ROBIN HOOD.<br>
During this screen, the player(s) may choose their skill levels and/or the<br>
number of players who are going to play (see skill levels). When the two<br>
player game is selected, the play action will alternate between No. 1 and<br>
player No. 2 after each life ROBIN looses. The game will return to the<br>
screen level each player was on when last in play.<br>
<br>
PLAY ACTION - SCREEN 2<br>
<br>
SHERWOOD FORREST AMBUSH<br>
You, ROBIN HOOD, are on your way from your hide-out deep in Sherwood Forrest<br>
to the Sheriff of Nottingham's castle to save MAID MARIAN and return the<br>
Sheriff's GOLD to the peasant farmers.<br>
As you approach the edge of Sherwood Forrest from the lower left part of the<br>
screen, the Sheriffs henchmen have hidden in ambush and you must fight your<br>
way out of the the forrest. You will have a total of six lives to complete<br>
your task, and each ROBIN will have a total of 16 arrows (see Score Display).<br>
The Sheriff's men will try to shoot ROBIN with an arrow or sneak up on him<br>
and stab him with a knive. Usually the henchmen will appear from behind the<br>
trees where they are hiding.<br>
By facing the henchmen and beeing on the same line on the screen, you can<br>
shoot these men by shooting your arrows (press FIRE BUTTON). You must shoot<br>
at least eleven of the Sheriff's men before you are able to go on to screen<br>
No. 3 (your score will flash to indicateyou are able to move on to the castle<br>
entrance).<br>
To move to screen No. 3, simply move ROBIN off the right side of the screen<br>
No. 2, but watch out! There may still be some men in ambush. Occasionally,<br>
ROBIN'S Merry Men appear, so be carefull who you shoot at! ROBIN loses a life<br>
if he shoots his own men.<br>
<br>
PLAY ACTION - SCREEN 3<br>
<br>
NOTTINGHAM CASTLE'S ENTRANCE<br>
As ROBIN comes out from Sherwood Forrest at the entrance to the Sheriff's<br>
castle, he will appear at the lower left corner on the screen. ROBIN should<br>
move to the center of the castle foreground for he must defeat six of the<br>
henchmen who are guarding the castle ground. Again, ROBIN has sixteen arrows<br>
to complete his entrance, and must be sure not to shoot any of his own men.<br>
<br>
When ROBIN has shot at least six men (your score will flash), he can sneak<br>
through the drawbridge or scale the right or left outer wall of the castle.<br>
<br>
To open the drawbridge, he must go to the middle of the screen just under the<br>
drawbridge itself. It will begin to open and close. A crossbow arrow from far<br>
away gives added security to the castle and danger for ROBIN. He must time<br>
entry to catch the drawbridge open and not be hit by the arrow.<br>
<br>
To climb the left or right side wall of the castle is very, very difficult.<br>
You must position ROBIN to the right of the stone ladder located on the right<br>
side of the screen, or to left of the stone ladder located on the left side<br>
of the screen. The feather in ROBINS hat should be just under the crossbow<br>
arrow that is protecting that part of the castle. The arrows sometimes are<br>
low and sometimes high, so watch carefully! When you see that ROBIN can climb<br>
the stone ladder and avoid the crossbow and drawbridge guard's arrows, move<br>
him straight up so his feather is just higher than midway up the wall. Next,<br>
move ROBIN over the ladder and move quickly over the top of the wall. Tough!<br>
<br>
PLAY ACTION - SCREEN 4<br>
<br>
INSIDE THE CASTLE<br>
ROBINwill appear at the left of the screen in the castle's basement dungeon.<br>
There will be three doors on this floor, one which hides a secret passage to<br>
the floor above, and the other two are guarded be henchmen. ROBIN must touch<br>
the door to open it and be prepared either to go through it if a henchmen<br>
comes out of another door, or run for another door if a henchmen is behind<br>
the one he touched. When he find the secret passage, he will appear on the<br>
next floor where two doors are located in the center of the room. You can see<br>
that there are stairs leading up to another level and two more doors. Behind<br>
one of the doors is either the Sheriff's GOLD treasure (taken from the poor<br>
peasants) or MAID MARIAN. Behind the other doors are henchmen with knives who<br>
will run after ROBIN and stab him.<br>
<br>
ROBIN has run out of arrows so he has only two ways of escaping from the<br>
Sheriff's men:<br>
<br>
1. Run up the stairs to the upper level (to run up the stairs you must keep<br>
ROBIN'S feet close to the top of each step by using the diagonal position<br>
of the joystick). Be carefull! If ROBIN steps off the stairs he will fall<br>
and be killed.<br>
<br>
2. Jumping off the stairs from the upper level (ROBIN may jump off the<br>
farthest right or left-hand step as long as he is facing left on the left<br>
side and right on the right side, and his feet are in the area just over<br>
the top step. After he jumps he must then quickly run to the opposite<br>
side of the room to escape the henchmen).<br>
<br>
Once ROBIN finds and touches MAID MARIAN or the GOLD treasure, he returns to<br>
Sherwood Forrest and play resumes in screen No. 2 in the next higher skill<br>
level.<br>
<br>
GAME ENDING<br>
The game ends when ROBIN runs out of lives.<br>
<br>
The two player game will end after both players lose all their lives.<br>
<br>
If the player were in different screens when their games ended, then the<br>
different ending screens will flash on the screen and show each player's<br>
score.<br>
<br>
POINT SCORING<br>
* Each henchmen is worth 2,000 points.<br>
* Saving MAID MARIAN is worth 20,000 points.<br>
* Stealing the Sheriff'S GOLD treasure is worth 20,000 points.<br>
* Successfully moving ROBIN through each screen is worth 8,000 points.<br>
