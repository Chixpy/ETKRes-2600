1. DESTROY THE KRYLONS...	AVENGE THE DOOMED PLANET!
	With Commander Champion and Li San O'Rourke in the Star Fighter, you're
	on the tail of the Krylon invaders.  You've taken an oath to destroy 
	the Krylons and avenge the Doomed Planet.

	Through interstellar space you hyperwarp faster than the speed of
	light, past uncharted stars and planets in an unexplored parallel
	universe.  Watch out!  You nearly collided wit an asteroid.  Run into an
	asteroid at this speed, and POW!  you're space dust.  Good thing the
	Star Fighter's protective shields are on.

	Check the Krylons' position on your Galactic Map.  Looks like they're
	heading for your starbase.  Given half a chance they'll destroy it to
	keep you from recharging and repairing the Star Fighter.  Their ships
	are fast, but you can hyperwarp anywhere n the galaxy in an instant...
	if your energy supply holds out.  It's a duel to the death.  Will you
	succeed in destroying the Krylons before they wipe out the starbase? 
	Will the Star Fighter perish like the Doomed Planet?  Or will you 
	complete your mission and return a hero?

2. GAME PLAY
	Your first mission is to destroy all Krylon warships and save the
	starbase.  Failing that, you must wipe out all Krylon ships before the
	Star Fighter is destroyed.  If you run out of energy or take a hit with
	your protective shields off, the Star Fighter blows up, Krylon takes 
	over the galaxy, and the game ends.  If you complete your mission and
	destroy all the Krylons, the ATARI FORCE computer evaluates your
	performance and assigns you a new rank, based on:

	* Mission skill level
	* Amount of energy remaining
	* Number of visits to the starbase for energy and repairs

	Mission Skill Level and Energy are shown on the Control Panel 
	(Figure 1) at the start of a game.  T10 means that at Skill Level 10,
	there are 10 targets.  The higher the skill level, the more targets,
	and the harder it is to survive.  Start at level 10 and work your way
	up to 40.  See Section 6 for descriptions of the mission skill levels.

	NOTE: Once the game starts, the T counter keeps track of targets
	remaining.

	[Figure 1 - Forward View and Control Panel (The Target Marker is shown
	to be at the center of the screen.  Energy Remaining is shown to be at
	the bottom left of the screen as E400.  Skill Level & Targets Remaining
	is at bottom center as T10)]

	The higher the skill level, the more energy units you start with.  If
	you run low on energy, you can recharge at the starbase, assuming
	Krylon hasn't destroyed it and you have enough energy to get there. 
	See ENERGY for additional information.

HOW TO PLAY
	Press GAME RESET to display the forward view from the front of the Star
	Fighter (Figure 1).  The computer signals game start with three tones 
	and automatically turns on the protective shields and Attack Computer.

	Shields keep the Star Fighter from being destroyed by Krylon photon
	torpedoes and asteroids, but they do not protect it against damage.

	NOTE: When shields are on, space appears blue; when they are off, space
	appears black.  When the Attack Computer is on, the Target Marker 
	appears in the middle of the screen (Figure 1).  If your shields and
	Attack Computer are not on, move both DIFFICULTLY switches to B.

	Now press the GAL MAP button on the Video Touch Pad(tm) (Key 2) to
	display the Galactic Map (figure 2).

GALACTIC MAP
	Each square on the Galactic Map represents a sector of interstellar
	space.  The map shows you:

	@@@@@@@
	  @@@@@@@       
	    @@@@@@@	Sector occupied by Krylon fighters (red wing*)

	*Note: Colors may vary, depending on your television control settings.


	[Figure 2 - Galactic Map (Omited)]

	Using your Joystick, move the red bar to the sector occupied by the
	Krylons. (Joystick operation is explained in Section 3.)  Now press the
	HYPERWARP button on the Video Touch Pad (key 3) to engage your
	hyperwarp engines.  Note that the blue bar (your current position)
	joins the red bar (new postion) when you engage your hyperwarp engines.

	When hyperwarp is completed, the screen flashes red and the red alert
	sounds to warn you that the Star Fighter has entered enemy territory.

	NOTE: Red alert also sounds when the enemy moves into a sector you are
	occupying.

	When you hear the red alert, press the FORE VIEW button (key 1) to
	return to the forward view (Figure 1).  Be prepared to engage the 
	Krylons in battle.

		 Cruisers        Fighters        Basestars

	All three ships are designed for high-speed attacks and are more
	maneuverable than the Star Fighter.  Fighters and cruisers do not have
	protective shields; they can be destroyed with one hit.  Basestars are
	protected by shields and can only be destroyed at close range.  All
	Krylon ships carry deadly photon torpedoes capable of seriously 
	damaging the Star Fighter.  At Skill Levels 30 and 40, Krylon pilots 
	are especially good shots.

ENGAGING THE ENEMY
	When the enemy is visible in the forward view, the computer emits three
	short tones.  Lock on your photon torpedoes (see ATTACK COMPUTER), and
	press the red button on your joystick to fire them.  The Star Fighter 
	is equipped with twin torpedo tubes on the port and starboard sides.  
	When the torpedoes are locked on, both tubes fire; otherwise only one 
	tube fires.

	NOTE: To hit targets at close range, aim below the Target Marker.  See
	Section 7, SURVIVAL INFORMATION, for details.

ATTACK COMPUTER
	The Attack Computer consists of the Control Panel, the Target Marker,
	and the Attack Computer Display (Figure 3).

	The color of the Control Panel indicates the postion and range of the
	target:

	RED	Behind you
	GREEN	In front and out of range
	BLUE	Visible and within range

	If the Control Panel turns BLACK, the computer is damaged(see DAMAGE).

	The Attack Computer Display tracks targets and locks on the photon
	torpedoes.  The computer tracks two targets at a time.  The dots shown
	in Figure 3 indicate the targets.  Line up a dot in the center of the 
	display to lock on the photon torpedoes.

	When lock-on occurs, the Target Marker changes from blue to red and the
	computer emits a short high-pitched tone.  This is the best time to 
	fire your photon torpedoes.

	[Figure 3 - Photon Torpedoes Locked On (Shows the Attack Computer
	Display to be at the lower right part of the screen with target as
	dots.  The dots corespond to the enemy Krylons on the screen.)]

FOLLOWING THE ENEMY
	Krylons move toward the starbase at a steady rate.  The more ships
	there are the slower they move.  At T10 the Krylons move one sector
	approximately every 30 seconds; at T40 they move a sector approximately
	every 70 seconds.  Unless you engage the hyperwarp engines, the Star
	Fighter follows the Krylons at the rate of one sector every 7 or 8
	seconds.

	When the Target Market (<-actual atari typo!) turns blue and the
	Control Panel remains green, it's a sure sign the enemy has moved on. 
	Check the Galactic Map and move the red bar into the new Krylon target
	sector.

	NOTE: No red alert sounds when you enter a target sector without
	hyperwarping.

STARBASE OCCUPIED
	The Krylons will destroy the starbase 30 seconds after they occupy it,
	unless you succeed in wiping them out.  The computer indicates starbase
	destroyed with the same three tones that signal game start and end of 
	game.

	After the base is destroyed, continue firing photon torpedoes at
	Krylons until you wipe them all out and complete your mission or the 
	Star Fighter blows up.

ASTEROID BELT
	When only one Krylon target remains, the Star Fighter plunges into an
	asteroid belt.  Asteroids can be as damaging as photon torpedoes. 
	Either maneuver around them or destroy them with your photon torpedoes.

ENERGY
	Every operation of the Star Fighter uses energy, as shown in the
	following table:

	Hyperwarp (sectors jumped) 		Energy Drain (units)
	----------------------------------------------------------------
		1					 20
		2					 50
		3					 70
		4					100
		5					120
		6					150


	Star Fighter Equipment or Sustained Hit 	Energy Drain (units)
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	Life Support System & Engines (always on)	.5 per second
	Attack Computer On				.5 per second
	Shields On					 1 per second
	Photon Torpedo Fired				 1
	Torpedo or Asteroid Hits Ship			 10

HYPERWARP
	The further you hyperwarp, the more energy it takes.  If you have a
	choice, a series of small jumps to a destination is better than one 
	long jump.

	At mission levels 10 and 20, the computer prevents you from
	hyperwarping when your energy supply is insufficient.  At levels 30 and
	40, always check the energy gauge on the Control Panel (see Figure 1)
	to be sure you have enough energy to make the jump.  If you run out of
	energy during the hyperwarp, the Star Fighter will blow up.  Section 7,
	SURVIVAL INFORMATION, has some tips on conserving energy.

LOW-ENERGY SIGNAL
	When energy falls below 100 units, the computer automatically shuts off
	the Target Marker.  Hyperwarp th the starbase and recharge immediately,
	if you have the energy to make it.  keep an eye on your energy gauge 
	and never allow it to fall below the level required to hyperwarp to the
	starbase.

RECHARGING
	While the Star Fighter is recharging, the screen flashes.  When the
	ship is fully recharged, COMPLETE appears at the bottom of the screen 
	(Figure	4).  After recharging, enter the Krylon target sector and 
	continue fighting.

	WARNING!  Recharging more than 7 times depletes the starbase and causes
	it to explode.

	[Figure 4. Recharging Completed (Shows Galactic Map with the word
	Complete in red at the bottom of the screen.)]

DAMAGE
	Damaged or destroyed equipment is indicated on the Control Panel
	(Figure 5).  One vist to the starbase repairs all damage.

	[Figure 5 - Damage Control(Shows the Control Panel with a letter, C,
	inbetween E105 and T30, indicating the Damage to the Star Fighter)]

	WARNING! If the Star Fighter is hit when its shields have flickered
	off, it will be destroyed.  Repair damaged shields immediately.  If 
	you can't make it to the starbase, good luck!

4. CONSOLE CONTROLS
GAME SELECT
	Press down the GAME SELECT switch to select the mission skill level:

		T10 = Skill Level 10 with 10 targets
		T20 = Skill Level 20 with 20 targets
		T30 = Skill Level 30 with 30 targets
		T40 = Skill Level 40 with 40 targets

	The skill level appears in the center of the Control Panel (Figure 1). 
	See Section 6 for descriptions of the mission skill levels.

GAME RESET
	Press down the GAME RESET switch to start your mission.  Also use this
	switch to start a new mission at the same skill level.

DIFFICULTLY SWITCHES
	Left Switch
	A - Attack Computer off.  Controlled from Video Touch Pad.
	B - Attack Computer on.  Controlled by computer.

	Right Switch
	A - Shields off.  Controlled from Video Touch Pad.
	B - Shields on.  Controlled by computer.

	Turning off the shields and Attack Computer saves energy.  However, if
	the Star Fighter is hit when its shields are off, it will be blasted 
	to space dust.  See Section 7, SURVIVAL INFORMATION, for some practical
	ways to use the shields and Attack Computer on/off options.

5. RATING
	The ATARI FORCE computer rates your performance and assigns you a rank
	and class when you complete your mission by destroying all the Krylon 
	targets.

	Rating 		Rank 			Class (Per Rank)
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	 0		Cook		 |
	 1		Scout		 |
	 2		Pilot		 |
	 3		Ace		 | Each rank has five classes.
	 4		Eagle		 | Class 5 is lowest, Class 1 is
	 5		Star		 | highest.
	 6		Nova		 | 
	 7+		? (mystery rank) |

You are rated according to the following formula:
	RANK = M + (energy remaining/100) - (Number of Starbase Visits/2)

	where M is a mission factor based on the mission skill level:

		   M	    Skill Level
		--------------------------
		   0		10
		   0.5		20
		   1.0		30
		   2.0		40

	NOTE: Number of Starbase Visits will not be divided by 2 if you visit
	the starbase more than 6 times.

	The Control Panel displays your new rank (Figure 9) alternately with
	the energy remaining data.

	[Figure 9 - New Rank (Shows Rank (SCOUT 4) at bottom of screen)]

	Rank corresponds to skill level as follows:

		10	Cook to Pilot 1
		20	Ace 5 to Ace 1
		30	Eagle 5 to Eagle 1
		40	Star 5 to Mystery Rank

	Any time your new rating (promotion or demotion) puts you on a
	different skill level, use the GAME SELECT switch to change the skill 
	level (see Section 4, CONSOLE CONTROLS).

6. MISSION SKILL LEVELS
	SKILL LEVEL 10
	* 10 targets; 400 energy units
	* Computer prevents hyperwarping when fuel is insufficient.
	* Krylon ships and the starbase are always on opposite sides of the
	  Galactic Map at the start of a mission.
	* Krylon photon torpedoes are not very accurate.  Light damage if any.

	SKILL LEVEL 20
	* 20 targets; 600 energy units
	* Computer prevents hyperwarping when fuel is insufficient.
	* Krylon ships and the starbase are on opposite sides of the Galactic
	  Map at the start of a mission.
	* Krylon photon torpedoes are fast and accurate.  Expect heavy damage.

	SKILL LEVEL 30
	* 30 targets; 800 energy units
	* Check energy gauge before hyperwarping.
	* Krylon ships and the starbase can be anywhere on the Galactic Map at
	  the start of a mission.
	* Krylon photon torpedoes are fast and accurate.  Expect heavy damage.
	* Recommended for advanced Star Fighter pilots.

	SKILL LEVEL 40
	* 40 targets; 900 energy units
	* Check energy gauge before hyperwarping.
	* Krylon ships and the starbase can be anywhere on the Galactic Map at
	  the start of a mission.
	* Enemy torpedoes are deadly.  Expect heavy damage.
	* Recommended for expert Star Fighter pilots only.

7. SURVIVAL INFORMATION

	[Figure 10 - Most Effective Firing Range for Close Targets (Shows the
	Effective Firing Range to be a semi circle radiating from the Control 
	Panel to the Target Marker.  Also, two enemy ships are shown to be 
	within this range.)]

EFFECTIVE FIRING RANGE
	Your target marker is adjusted to show where photon torpedoes converge
	at infinity.  Don't expect to hit a target lined up in the target 
	marker unless it is very far away (a small dot).  When targets are 
	closer lower your aim. Figure 10 shows the most effective firing range
	for targets the same size as photon torpedoes.  Pull back on the 
	Joystick to bring the targets into firing range.

RECHARGING IN STARBASE SECTOR
	If energy runs low while you're fighting in the starbase sector, make
	one hyper warp jump out of the starbase sector and immediately recharge.

CONSERVE ENERGY
	Turning off the Attack Computer and shields while hyperwarping or
	changing sectors saves 1.5 energy units per second.  The energy saved 
	might be enough for you to reach the star base and recharge.  Don't 
	forget to turn your shields and computer back on before entering the 
	target sector.  (See VIDEO TOUCH PAD in Section 3 for use of the 
	shields and Attack Computer on/off options.)
