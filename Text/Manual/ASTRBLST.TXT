(1 Player vs. Computer) 

Hit as many falling, fast-moving targets as you can. Move your laser base to avoid being hit yourself. Keep
shooting as long as your bases last, and try for a great Peak Score!

THE GAME 

You start with 10 laser defense bases. Several things fall from the sky: rocks, spinning white bombs, "smart"
guided missiles and - when your score goes over 20,000 - UFO bombs. If your active laser is hit OR a
spinner lands, you lose that base. You get another base whenever your peak score goes up 1,000 points. As
the score goes higher more targets appear - falling faster. 

CONTROLLERS 

Use joysticks or one paddle controller. The paddle moves the base faster, and we recommend it for a better
game. Plug paddles or joystick into LEFT CONTROLLER jack.

Press red button to shoot ... hold in for repeat firing.

DIFFICULTY SWITCHES 

RIGHT SWITCH: Set at "B" to play game at regular skill level. Set at "A" to play at accelerated speed
(same pace and targets as if score were over 50,000). 

LEFT SWITCH: Set at "B" for manual firing mode. Set at "A" for automatic firing. NOTE: Switches can be
changed during the game. 

ACTION! 

TO START THE GAME, DEPRESS RESET SWITCH, THEN PRESS CONTROLLER BUTTON. 

Move your active laser base to get directly under a target, then fire your laser. Avoid being hit by any falling
object. 

The number at lower right shows how many laser bases you have. You get a new base whenever your peak
score increases 1,000 points. 

NOTE: If your score goes down, then rises, you don't get an extra base when you pass your old peak level.
You must advance another 1,000 points to win a bonus base. 

WHEN ALL BASES ARE LOST, THE GAME ENDS AND YOUR PEAK SCORE APPEARS. 

TARGETS 


      OO  OO
      OOOOOO  OO      Rocks ... A small rock gives you twice as many points
      OOOOOOOO                  as a big one.  And small rocks that land
    OOO  OOOOOO                 unhit cost you twice as many points.  When
    OOOO  OOOOOO                big rocks are hit they usually split in two.
      OOOOOOOOOOOO

      OOOOOOOO     Spinners ... If a spinner lands, it costs you one laser
      OO  OO                    base.  Spinners make audible alarm signals.

    OOOOOO      Pulsars ... These guided missiles try to home in on your
  OOOOOOOOOO                base, and change course as they fall.  You don't
  OOOOOOOOOO                lose points if pulsars land, but if you can hit
    OOOOOO                  one, it has the value of 8 big rocks.  Pulsars
      OO                    make a beeping sound as they attack.
      OO


      OOOOOO
    OOOO  OOOO
    OOOO  OOOO    UFO's ... When your score is over 20,000, UFOs occasionally
      OOOOOO                fly past, dropping bombs on your active base
      OOOOOO                location.  You get no points for hitting the
    OOOOOOOOOO              bombs, but each UFO hit is worth 10 large rocks.
  OOOOOOOOOOOOOO            UFOs make a distinctive sound as they fly across.
  OO  OO  OO  OO

IF YOU ARE HIT, WAIT FOR EXPLOSION TO STOP THEN PRESS BUTTON TO CONTINUE. 

SCORING 

The number at the lower center of the screen is your current score. It changes when you hit a target, when
rocks land, and when you lose a base. Score increases when you hit ...

SCORE IS NEVER LESS THAN ZERO.

WINNING TIPS 

     Whenever you have a choice between big and small rocks, shoot at the small ones. 

     Don't shoot rocks very close to you - the explosion can blow up your base. 

     Remember: if any spinners land, you lose a base. Shoot at them as soon as they appear. 

     Don't try to run away from pulsars and UFOs.. Get directly underneath them fast - then shoot!
