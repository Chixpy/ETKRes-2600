ZiMAG GAME INSTRUCTIONS
<strong><big><big>I WANT MY MOMMY</big></big></strong>
KidStuff-FOR 8 YRS OF AGE AND UNDER


SETTING UP
1. Connect your video game system to the television according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

2. Make sure the console is off, then firmly push in your ZiMAG video
game cartridge.

3. Now you can turn on the console. A clear image should appear on the
screen. If not, check to see that the console is properly set up.

4. Next, plug the joystick into the left controller jack. If you are
playing a two player game, you will need to plug the other joystick into
the right controller jack.

5. If all of the above has been properly completed, you're ready to
play. Good Luck!


TEDDY WANT MOMMY
Poor Teddy. He's had a bad dream and now he wants his mommy. How about
giving him a hand? Steer him toward the magical stardust ladders. Help
him avoid the nasty dream demons who try to block his path. (Mom's
sending special kisses to help him out too.) Now if the little guy can
just make it up a couple of big mountains, he'll get a big bear hug.


MOVING TEDDY
To move Teddy, all you have to do is push the joystick left or right. If
you think Teddy should go up to the next level, just move him on top of
a flashing dot, press the action button on your controller, and push the
joystick up. See? You should hear a neat rising sound. If you think
Teddy should go down a ladder, just put him over the top of it, and push
the joystick down.


STARTING THE GAME
Anytime you want to start a game all you have to do is press the &quot;game
reset&quot; switch on your game console.


SCORING
Remember you're trying to get Teddy back to his mommy as fast as you
can. The lower the number at the top of the screen, the faster you got
there.


GAME FEATURES
On the T.V. screen you can see how many tries Teddy has left. If there's
one picture of Teddy, you have one try left. If there are three pictures
of Teddy, you have three tries left. Get it?

You also have a kiss from Mommy to help you when you're in trouble. It's
the little colored block floating around. If you make Teddy run into it,
he'll become strong enough to hit those mean dream demons, and knock
them out.

To get to the apple at the top of the screen, first you have to put up
all the stardust ladders, then climb up the top one. Then you should see
the next screen with Teddy's Mommy trying to hug him. Try to put all the
ladders up, then get Teddy to his Mommy!


GETTING THERE FASTER
Remember, all the stardust ladders must be in place to reach the top.
It's a good idea not to leave too many undone below. On the first
mountain you'll be safe from the dream demons on the top of the ropes.
Try to catch as many love kisses as possible.
