OBJECT
------

To score as many points as possible by destroying a relentless swarm of
IMPERIAL TIE FIGHTERS, a barrage of deadly fireballs, and a maze of
sinister laser towers before finally blasting the infamous DEATH STAR
from existence.


SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS
----------------------------

1. Place the cartridge firmly into the cartridge slot at the top of the
   Atari unit.
2. Turn the ON/OFF switch to ON.
3. Set the LEFT DIFFICULTY SWITCH:
   Position A (Expert): you begin the game at WAVE 3.
   Position B (Novice): you begin the game at WAVE 1.
4. To begin play, press the GAME RESET switch on the console.


THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLER
-----------------------

Because this is a one-player game, plug the joystick controller into the
jack labelled &quot;1.&quot;

The joystick operates much like the flight controls of an X-WING FIGHTER.
To gain altitude (fly upwards), pull BACKWARDS on the joystick.
To dive (fly downwards), push FORWARDS on the joystick.
To fly left or right, simply move the joystick in those directions.


PLAYING
-------

In this game, there are increasing WAVES of difficulty. Each WAVE
features 3 Rounds (except for WAVE 1). The rounds involve: (1) destroying
fireballs and shooting down TIE FIGHTERS patrolling the DEATH STAR,
(2) blasting fireballs and the tops off of LASER TOWERS along the
surface of the DEATH STAR, and (3) destroying fireballs while avoiding
CATWALKS in the DEATH STAR'S EQUATORAL TRENCH. It is in this last round
that you must also hit the MAIN REACTOR PORT on the floor of the TRENCH
with a PROTON TORPEDO to destroy the DEATH STAR completely!

You'll begin the game at WAVE 1, Round 1 with 8 energy shields. Each time
you successfully complete a WAVE, you'll automatically advance to the
next and more difficult one with your remaining number of energy shields
(NOTE: the maximum numbers of energy shields you can have at one time is
8). When you lose all 8 energy shields, and are hit by a fireball, tower,
or CATWALK, the game ends and you must begin again.
MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU*


SHOOTING IMPERIAL TIE FIGHTERS
------------------------------

Round #1
  The IMPERAL FLEET approaches! Their mission - to protect the DEATH STAR
at all costs. These TIE FIGHTERS are armed with deadly fireballs. It's
up to you to blast as many TIE FIGHTERS and fireballs as possible to gain
the most points. Each time a fireball impacts your ship, you lose 1
energy shield. Of course, DARTH VADER will not sit idly by as you attempt
to destroy his FLEET! Amidst the barrage of IMPERAL TIE FIGHTERS, you'll
occasionally see one blue TIE FIGHTER. That's DARTH VADER's ship! Be
careful - but be quick to blast him with your PHOTON TORPEDOES and you'll
gain extra points. Survive this round and advance to the next one with
your remaining energy shields.


BLASTING LASER TOWERS
---------------------

Round #2
  You've made it past the IMPERAL FLEET and now you're streaking across
the surface of the DEATH STAR. Suddenly, you're caught in a maze of
sinister looking LASER TOWERS that rise into the darkness of space.
You'll have to do some fancy flying if you're to avoid hitting them with
your X-WING FIGHTER. Set your sights on the tops of these towers as you
fly by and try to blast them with your TORPEDOES. For each tower top you
blast, you gain extra points.

  And by the way, keep an eye out for those deadly fireballs. They're
still out there (and after your ship)! Destroy them for extra points,
too. Each time a fireball hits your ship, or your X-WING FIGHTER hits a
tower, you lose 1 energy shield.

  Survive this round and advance to the next one your remaining number
of energy shields.


SURVIVING THE EQUATORAL TRENCH
------------------------------

Round #3
  Beyond the LASER TOWERS lies the DEATH STAR's EQUATORAL TRENCH. Once
you're in it, get ready to fly like you've never flown before! As if
the attacking fireballs aren't enough, there are all sorts of CATWALKS
to avoid as you speed through this narrow passageway. Fly over, under,
and around them - just don't hit them. Each time you do, or if you're
hit by a fireball, you lose an ENERGY SHIELD. Destroy fireballs along
the way for extra points or, better yet, USE THE FORCE.

  When you've made it past all the CATWALKS, keep an eye on the
TRENCH's floor. When you see the MAIN REACTOR PORT, let the PROTON 
TORPEDOES fly. Make a direct hit and DEATH STAR explodes! The REBEL
BASE is once again safe from the forces of the EMPIRE.

  Survive this round and advance to the next WAVE with your remaining
number of energy shields - plus bonus shields.


END OF WAVE
-----------

Each WAVE ends when you successfully complete all three rounds.


WAVE SELECTION AND PROGRESSION
------------------------------

	After turning the game unit ON, you may select WAVES 1 or 3 to
begin playing by pressing the GAME SELECT SWITCH. You cannot select
WAVES 4 and up; you must survive WAVE 3 to advance to WAVE 4, and so on.

WAVE #  ACTION

1       EASY
        no CATWALKS in EQUATORAL TRENCH
2       MEDIUM
        CATWALKS in EQUATORAL TRENCH
3 &amp; up  HARD
        CATWALKS


END OF GAME
-----------

The game ends when you run out of ENERGY SHIELDS and are hit by a
fireball, tower, or CATWALK. To play again, simply press the GAME RESET
switch and follow the steps described in SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS.
