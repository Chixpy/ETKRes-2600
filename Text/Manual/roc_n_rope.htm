<p><big><strong>A LEGENDARY QUEST</strong></big><br>
<br>
Is the Golden Roc merely a myth? Or does it really exist? Find out in Coleco's ROC N'
ROPE, a game of skill and speed.<br>
<br>
In your quest for the Golden Roc, you'll travel through a prehistoric landscape made up of
hazardous ledges and treacherous cliffs.<br>
Scale the heights with your trusty rope and use your powerful flashlight to daze the
lumbering dinosaurs and the swift footed cavemen.<br>
Fortunately, the Golden Roc has left a trail of magical eggs. Gather them as you go and
use their powers to make the dinosaurs and cavemen disappear. But watch your step! If you
slip while on the edge of a cliff, you'll plummet to the depths below!<br>
The treasures of the Golden Roc are yours when you reach the summit. But you must journey
on. The fabled bird awaits you at the top of another perilous climb!<br>

<br>
<br>
<big><strong>USING YOUR CONTROLS</strong></big><br>
<br>
1. Control Stick: Move the Control Stick left or right to make your explorer move in the
selected direction. Move it up (away from you) to make him grab a rope when he is at a
rope stake, then left or right to make him climb in the selected direction. Move the
Control Stick up to make your explorer get off the rope when he's at the top of the rope.
Move the Control Stick down (toward you) to make the explorer climb down off a ledge onto
a rope. If you move the Control Stick down when the explorer is on a rope, he falls.<br>
<br>
2. Play/Action Button: Press the Play/Action Button while the Control Stick is in the up
position to make your explorer shoot a rope. Your explorer cannot shoot another rope while
still on a rope.<br>
<br>
Press the Play/Action Button when the Control Stick is in any other position to make your
explorer shine his flashlight, whether he is on or off a rope.<br>
<br>
<big><strong>HERE'S HOW TO PLAY</strong></big><br>
<br>
High adventure<br>
when your journey begins, you face a series of dangerous cliffs. You must climb from ledge
to ledge by shooting your rope until you reach the Golden Roc perched on the highest
cliff. Before the action begins, you'll notice a number in the upper portion of your
screen, indicating current player up. It is followed by a group of small explorers,
indicating how many explorers that player has remaining. Now you're ready to start your
quest.<br>
<br>
Tick... Tick... Tick<br>
A Bonus Timer shows at the top-center of each scene. It starts at 5,000 points and counts
down to zero for each scene. If your explorer reaches the Golden Roc before the timer hits
zero, you earn the number of points left in the timer as a bonus. If the timer hits zero
before you complete the scene, you lose an explorer.<br>
<br>
The end of your rope<br>
There's only one way to scale those cliffs: Shoot your rope to the level above, then start
climbing! Be careful--rope shaking dinosaurs and fast-footed cavemen are close on your
heels!<br>
<br>
Blinded by the light<br>
If you're quick with the switch, you can use your flashlight to daze the dinosaurs and
cavemen. Earn 20 points for stunning an enemy; earn 600 points and eliminate the enemy if
your energized when you daze him. Then quickly slip past them. But don't even try to daze
a caveman in mid-jump--it just won't work!<br>
<br>
Movers and Shakers<br>
When a caveman pauses by your rope stake, he's looking for trouble! Stop climbing and hold
on tight or he may shake the rope out from under you!<br>
<br>
A chew!<br>
What big teeth those dinosaurs have! They'll do their best to chew right through the rope
you're climbing. Scurry in hurry when they reach your rope stake!<br>
<br>
Scramble for eggs!<br>
The eggs left behind by the Golden Roc contain magical powers. Touch one and you're
energized! Earn 800 points for every egg you touch. See how you glow with their magical
powers!! Any enemy you touch is eliminated. Earn 600 points for each enemy you eliminate
while energized. But don't count on the magic to last long!<br>
<br>
Journey's end<br>
When you make it to the final cliff, shoot your rope one more time. It should take you to
the Golden Roc. You've done very well for a cub explorer, but more adventures await you in
scene two!<br>
<br>
Onward and upward<br>
Once you've made it through all three scenes, keep adventuring to reach the Golden Roc.
The rewards awaiting you are worth the challenges you will face!<br>
<br>
Starting over<br>
Your adventure ends when all your explorers are eliminated.<br>
Press Game Reset switch or Play/Action Button to play<br>
again at the same skill level and number of players; press Game Select to choose another
challenge.<br>
<br>
