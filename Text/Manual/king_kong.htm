<h2><font size="4" face="Courier New">KING KONG<br>
<br>
</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">A one or two player game for <br>
the Atari Video Computer System<br>
or Sears Tele-Games<br>
using joystick controllers </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">_____________________________________________________________________<br>
<strong>King Kong(tm) </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">King Kong has captured the girl and put her on top of
the Empire State Building. You must climb up and save her. But watch out, King Kong is
throwing bombs. If you're quick, you can jump over them and score points. But if you miss,
you'll be blown to bits. Some of the bombs are magic. if you jump them, you'll score extra
points and get boosted to the next higher floor. There are holes in some of the floors
too. You have to take a running jump to get over these, or else you'll fall through...and
splat. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>INSTRUCTIONS </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Use your joystick controllers with this
TIGERVISION(tm) game cartridge. For a one player game, use the left joystick only. Hold
the joystick with the red button to your upper left. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>NOTE:</strong> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Make sure the console unit is turned off when
removing or plugging in the game cartridge. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>GAME SELECTION:</strong> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Turn the console unit on. The game number will be
displayed at the top of the TV screen. See the game feature chart for the particular
features associated with each game number. Press the game select switch to select the
desired game number. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>STARTING THE GAME</strong> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">When you are ready to play, press the game reset
switch. King Kong will jump up to the seventh floor of the building and put the girl on
top of the building. You will start with three men, displayed at the lower left of the TV
screen for player one: at the lower right for player two. When your man is killed, the
number of men you have left will be displayed. When you've lost your third man, the game
is over. At the end of a two player game, the players' scores will be displayed
alternately. Player one's score will be displayed with a man at the lower left, player
two's with a man at the lower right. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>JOYSTICK CONTROLLER ACTION </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">You control the man with your joystick. Move the
handle left and the man will walk to the left. Move the handle right and the man will walk
to the right. When the man is at the foot of one of the ladders, push the handle forward
and the man will climb up. Pull the handle back and the man will climb back down. When the
man is standing, press the red button on the joystick and the man will jump straight up.
if the man is walking, press the red button and the man will jump in an arc. When the man
is climbing, he can't jump. Also, when the man is on the top floor of the building, he
can't jump. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New"><strong>SCORING </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Jumping over a bomb will add 25 points to your score.
Jumping over a magic bomb will add 125 points to your score. Bonus points are displayed at
the top right of the TV screen. The bonus points start at 990 and count down at 10 points
per second. When the man reaches the top of the building, the bonus points will be added
to your score. The faster you get the man to the top, the higher your bonus. If the bonus
points reach zero, your man is killed. </font></p>
