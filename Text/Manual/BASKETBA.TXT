Use your Joystick Controllers with this Game Program TM. Be sure the 
Controllers are firmly connected to your Video Computer System TM. See 
your Owner's Manual for details. Hold the Controllers with the red button 
to your upper left towards the television screen. To play against the 
computer, use the right hand controller.





NOTE: To prolong the life of your Atari Video Computer System and 
protect the electronic components, the Console unit should be OFF when 
inserting or removing a Game Program.






CONTROLLER ACTION





Moving your Joystick Controller according to the diagram will move
your player around the court.





   Up and     Move      Up and
   Left       Up        Right
               ^
             \ | /

              /|\
            /  |  \
               v
   Down       Move      Down and
   and Left   Down      Right






The player with the ball will dribble automatically and will always face the 
goal. The defending player will always face the ball.





To shoot, depress the red controller button. Your player will stop dribbling
and will hold the ball, waving it back and forth over his head (as shown in 
the diagram). When the controller button is released, the player will shoot. 
If the shot is made when the ball is over the player's head, it will be a long, 
high arching shot. If the shot is made when the ball is held low in front, it 
will be a short easy shot. The shot will always go towards the goal.





To defend against your opponent's shot, place yourself between the ball 
and the goal. When the shooter releases the ball, depress your red 
controller button. Your player will jump and you can block the shot and 
recover the ball. You can only block a shot when the ball is in its 
"upward" arc: there is no "goaltending" in this game.





To steal the ball, put the player's feet even with your opponent's feet. 
When the ball leaves your opponent's hand during the dribble, take the ball 
and race towards your own basket. Stealing the ball comes much easier 
with practice and will become an integral part of your defense strategy.






HANDICAP





When the Difficulty Switch on your console unit is in the B position, your 
player can move from goal to goal much more quickly than the A position. 
Thus a beginning player, using the B position, will be able to defend more 
easily and will be able to "outrun" his opponent.





TO BEGIN PLAY





Visualize that you are sitting at center court about six rows back. The 
bottom of the playfield is the near side of the court. The goals are in the 
center of the two endlines. The top of the court is the side farthest from 
you.





As shown in the above diagram, the two players are standing at center 
court, waiting for the "jump ball" to begin the game.





The left or green player's score is shown at the top left of the playfield; the 
right or lavendar player's score is shown at the top right. Between the two 
scores is a time clock. When the game begins, this clock will begin 
counting backwards from 4:00. For any score to count, it must go through 
the basket before the game ends at 0:00.





To start the game with a jump ball (after setting your Difficulty Switch), 
depress the Game Reset switch on your Console unit. When the switch is 
released the ball will be thrown straight up. When the ball comes down the 
game is underway.





When a basket is made, the player making the basket is reset to center 
court to defense. His opponent will be reset under the basket to receive the 
ball and make his offensive moves.





The line under each basket are the court endlines. A defensive player can 
cross over either endline. An offensive player cannot dribble the ball over 
the endline nearest to his offensive goal. This features stops any "stall" 
tactics.





Game 1 Two-player Game





In this version, you are against your opponent. To make your game more 
interesting, try playing two 4:00 halves, changing controllers at halftime.





Game 2 One-player Game





Using the right hand controller, it's you against the computer... and our 
computer is programmed to increase your playing skill. The closer the 
score, the better his defense and he will make more offensive moves. Try 
not to let the computer get more than an 8-point lead, because after he
has let you close the score, his defense will tighten much sooner.





Suggestion: At first place the left Difficulty Switch in the A position and 
the right Difficulty Switch in the B position. If you can beat the computer 
6 to 8-points, consider yourself a skillful player. Then move the left 
Difficulty Switch to the B position. If you can beat the computer by more 
than 4-points, you are a superior player.
