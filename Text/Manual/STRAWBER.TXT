Now a video activity game that's full of lively music, colorful matching, 
and "berry" fun times!  Strawberryland(tm)* is all mixed up - thanks to 
the Purple Pieman.(tm)*  Strawberry Shortcake and her friends Blueberry 
Muffin,(tm)* Lime Chiffon,(tm)* and Huckleberry Pie(tm)* were going to 
put on a musical talent show.  But the Purple Pieman ruined everything.  
He didn't want anyone to have any fun, so he cast an evil spell on them.  
Now everyone has a body that's all mixed up - even the Purple Pieman.  
Can you put everyone back together the way they're supposed to be?  When 
you do, the Strawberryland characters will dance for joy!

OBJECT
The object of the game is to correctly "put together" as many 
Strawberryland characters as you can.

THE STRAWBERRY LAND CHARACTERS
Insert the cartridge into your unit, then move the ON/OFF switch to ON.  
One at a time, you'll see the five Strawberryland characters that you 
want to correctly put together.  You'll also see each character's name at 
the base of the gazebo (names not shown in the following illustrations).

THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLERS
Plug one Joystick controller firmly into the LEFT jack at the back of 
your video system.  This cartridge is played by one player at a time.  

Use the Joystick to choose the head, body, and legs for each character.  
Move the Joystick UP or DOWN to choose which part of the body you want to 
find first.  Each time you move the controller UP or DOWN, a vertical 
indicator line will move up or down each side of character.  This 
indicates the part (head, body, or legs) that you'll try to find.

Then move the Joystick LEFT or RIGHT to see each of the choices you have 
for that particular part of the body.

When you've selected a head, body, and legs that you think are correct, 
press the red button.

PLAYING
One Berry Game

-- A mixed-up character will appear on the screen.  Use the Joystick to 
put together a Strawberryland character that you think is correct.  When 
you've selected a head, body, and legs that you think are correct, press 
the red button.

* If you're right, you'll see the character's name at the base of the 
gazebo.  You'll also hear the character's talent show tune and see his or 
her legs dance to the music.  When the music and dancing end, you'll see 
another mixed-up character that needs to be correctly put together.

{Page 4}

* If you're wrong, you'll hear a mixed-up tune that's made up of a bit of 
the tune for each character's part you've selected.  For example, if you 
have the Purple Pieman's head with Strawberry Shortcake's body and Lime 
Chiffon's legs, you'll hear a tune that has a little bit of the Purple 
Pieman's tune, Strawberry Shortcake's tune, and LIme Chiffon's tune. 

You'll also see the character's legs dance to the music, but you won't 
see a name below the character you've assembled.  When the music and 
dancing end, you'll see the same character for you to correctly put together.

Two Berry Game
-- A mixed-up character will appear on the screen.
-- A character's name will appear at the base of the gazebo.

Use the Joystick to put together the Strawberryland character whose name 
now appears on the screen.  When you think you've correctly put together 
that character, press the red button.

* If you're right, you'll see the character's name and watch the 
character dance to his or her tune.  Play continues with another mixed-up 
character and name.

* If you're wrong, you'll watch the character dance to a mixed-up tune.  
Then the same character will stay on the screen for you to correctly put 
together.  The character's name will disappear, so you must remember the 
name you just saw.

THREE BERRY GAME
--A mixed-up character will appear on the screen.
--A character's name will appear at the base of the gazebo.
--A sun will appear at the top left side of the screen. This is the "timer."

Use the Joystick to put together the Strawberryland character whose name 
now appears on the screen-but before the sun timer moves all the way 
across the sky to the top right side of the screen.  When you think 
you've correctly put together that character, press the red button.  The 
sun timer will stop.

*If you're right, you'll see the character's name and watch the character 
dance to his or her tune.  Play continues with another mixed-up character 
and name, with the sun timer at the top left side of the screen.

*If you're wrong, you'll watch the character dance to a mixed-up tune.  
Then the same character will stay on the screen for you to correctly put 
together in the time lefto on the sun timer.  The character's name will 
disappear, so you must remember the name you just saw.

*If you don't correctly put together the character before the time's up, 
the sky will darken and the game will end.  The Strawberryland characters 
will appear - one at a time - on the screen.  To play again at the same 
game, press GAME RESET.

--A character's name will appear at the base of the gazebo.

FIVE BERRY GAME

--A mixed-up character will appear on the screen.
--A character's tune will play at the beginning of the game.
--A sun will appear at the top left side of the screen. This is the "timer."

Use the Joystick to put together the Strawberryland character whose tune 
you just heard - but before the sun timer moves all the way across the 
sky to the top right side of the screen.  When you think you've correctly 
put together that character, press the red button.

*If you're right, you'll see the character's name and watch the character 
dance to his or her tune.  Play continues with another mixed-up character 
and tune, with the sun timer at the top left side of the screen.

*If you're wrong, you'll watch the character dance to the tune you heard 
at the beginning of the game.  But you won't see the correct character's 
name appear at the base of the gazebo.  Then the incorrect character will 
stay on the screen for you to correctly put together in the time left on 
the sun timer.

*If you don't correctly put together the character before the time's up, 
the sky will darken and the game will end.  The Strawberyland characters 
will appear - one at a time - on the screen.  To play again at the same 
game, press GAME RESET.
