Use your Standard Paddle Controllers with this game program.
Be sure to plug the Controller cables firmly into the Video
Computer System TM jacks. See your Video Computer Owner's
Manual for details. You will need another set of paddle
Controllers for three players to play Black Jack. During one
or two-player games, plug your Standard Controllers into the
left side of the Console.





Note: To prolong the life of your Atari Video Computer System
and protect the electronic components, the Console unit should
be OFF when inserting or removing a game program.





HOW TO PLAY BLACK JACK





Place your bets, casino gamblers! And you're ready to play
Black Jack. One, 2 or 3 players compete against the computer
dealer. The computer deals each player two cards face-up. The
computer also deals two card to itself - one face-up and the
other face-down. After that, Lady Luck and your sharp skill
determines the winner.





Each card is worth points:

.--.
|5 |      Number cards = 
`--'      Face Value (i.e. 5 = 5 points)

.--. .--. .--. .--.      10, Jack (J), Queen (Q) and King (K) 
|10| |J | |Q | |K |      = 10 points
`--' `--' `--' `--'

.--.
|A |
`--'      Ace (A) = 1 or 11 points







A card hand is called "soft" when the Ace is used as 11
points. A card hand is "hard" when any combination of cards is
used except an Ace worth 11 points. For exemple, a soft 17 is
an Ace (11 points) and a 6. A hard 17 could be a 10, 6 and an
Ace (1 point).





The object of the game is to get 21 points, or as close to 21
points without "busting" (exceeding 21 points). You
automatically score a Black Jack when your first two cards
equal 21 points.





If you are satisfied with the points of your first two cards,
stay on tht hand. If you want to add more points to your hand,
request a hit, and the dealer will give you another card. You
may continue to hit until you are satisfied with your hand
(stay) - or until you exceed 21 points and lose the game
(bust).





When all players have played their hands, the dealer reveals
the face-down card. Like all the players, the dealer will hit
or stay to get as close to 21 points without busting.





You win the game when:



•Your card hand is equal to more points than the dealer's
     hand without exceeding 21 points.
•The dealer busts and exceeds 21 points.
•You score a Black Jack (An Ace and a face card or a 10).







NOTE: A tie game (push) occurs when the dealer's card points
equal your card points.





BETTING





Each player starts play with a total of 200 chips. Bet from 1-
25 chips on each game. Your bet is added or subtracted from
your total score depending on whether you win or lose. When
you score a Black Jack, you win 1 1/2 times your bet. For
example, you score Black Jack on a bet of 10 chips and win 15
chips! A player is automatically removed from the game when he
has 1000 chips or no chips remain in his score.





NOTE: You may double your bet BEFORE the first hit. After you
double the bet, you must take one hit. No other hits are
allowed.





GAME SELECT SWITCH: Use this switch for the following:



•CONTROL THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS - Press the Game Select
     Switch to cycle through all the positions of game set-ups
     for one, two or three players. Release the switch when
     the number of set-ups you want appears on the screen.
•LEAVING THE GAME - A player can leave the game at any
     time. To stop play action, push the Game Select Swicth
     until your set-up disappears. (Other players' set-up will

     the Game Select until you set-up reappears on the screen
     along with any other set-ups of players who had been
     playing.
•GOING BROKE - When you Go Broke (lose all your chips),
     you can still play by asking the bank for another set-up.
     Stop the play action and push the Game Select Switch to
     cycle through all the set-ups. When your new set-up
     appears along with the other players' previous set-ups,
     release the switch. Now place your bets and continue
     play.
•BREAKING THE BANK - When you have 1000 chips, you Break
     the Bank! Now you must start play again with 200 chips.
