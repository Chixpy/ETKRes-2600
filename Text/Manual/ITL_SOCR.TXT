THE GAME

There are 2 teams - YELLOW and BLUE. For the first half, Yellow 
defends the TOP goal, Blue defends the bottom goal. Teams switch ends 
for the second half.

A KICK-OFF begins each half of the game and starts play after a goal is
scored. Yellow team kicks off the first half. Blue team kicks off the 
Second half. Team scored AGAINST klcks off after a goal.

To kick off, move the man in the kick-off circle. Until this happens, player 
on defense has no control over his team. Once the man in the kick-off 
circle is moved, both teams may try for possession of the ball. To get 
possession, move your man so he touches the ball.

WHEN YOU HAVE THE BALL, move it toward your opponent's goal 
by dribbling or passing. Shoot into the net.

When a goal is scored, the CLOCK STOPS and the ball returns to the
kick-off circle. Teams take up kick-off positions CLOCK STARTS again 
at kick-off.
    
WHEN PLAYING DEFENSE, try to steal or intercept he ball. Your
man can outrun the ball carrier. If your opponent gets close to your
goal, move your controlled man to protect it. Computer controlled men
might not stop the ball.
						       
No offsides, goalies, throw-ins, corner kicks, goal kicks, penalties,
time-outs or overtime.


CONTROLLING YOUR MAN

Use the LEFT joystlck controller for the YELLOW team. Use the RIGHT
Joystick controller for the BLUE team.

You control ONE man on your team. When you have the ball your 
controlled man is the ball carrier. When playing defense, your controlled 
man does not change.

All members of a team are the same color but the controlled man has a
different shape when not moving, so you can tell hlm apart.

TO MOVE YOUR CONTROLLED MAN, push the joystick in any of 8 
directions. If your man has the ball, moving him will DRIBBLE THE 
BALL.
(Remember that dribbling slows your man down.)

TO PASS OR KICK THE BALL, press the RED BUTTON. The ball  
travel in the last direction in which the Joystick as pushed.

NOTE THE DIFFICULTY SWITCHES ARE NOT USED IN THIS 
GAME. Game speed and level of difficulty are the same regardless of 
Difficulty Switch positlon.


PLAYING DETAILS

TO STEAL THE BALL:

*	Overrun or intercept your opponent, so your man touches the ball.
Move quickly away or opponent's man will steal it back.

*	Intercept a pass.

*	If one of your computer-controlled men gets the ball, he becomes
your new controlled man.

PASSING:

*	Ball carrier can pass the ball while moving or standing still.

*	When the ball is passed, computer-controlled men on both teams
will move horizontally to intercept the pass.

*	If the ball carrier gets too close to a boundary and shoots directly at
it, the ball will bounce off the boundary and pass through the ball carrier 
on its return. This does not happen when the ball is kicked into the net 
regardless of the distance from which it is kicked.

SCROLLING:

As the ball moves downfield, the screen will move - or SCROLL - in the 
opposite direction, so the ball is never off screen. The screen will stop 
scrolling when either goal comes fully into view.

If a man goes of the top or bottom of the screen during scrolling he will 
reappear at the other end of the screen, in the same relative place. This 
feature is useful for:

*	PASSING If a team member is moving off screen, pass the ball to 
the point where he will reappear.

*	GOAL DEFENSE. Your controlled man may be too far from
your goal to reach it in time to defend it. Move him in the opposite 
direction, until he disappears off the end of the screen opposite your goal. 
He will reappear at the goal.


WINNING TIPS
                                
*	LEARN TO PASS EFFECTIVELY. Watch how team members 
move off and on screen, as the screen scrolls. Make the scrolling effect
work to your advantage with off-screen passing.

*	WATCH YOUR AIM when you pass or shoot. Wild shots and
passes may be intercepted by your opponent

*	STEAL THE BALL. Remember that the man with the ball is 
slowed down by dribbling.

*	WHEN PLAYING DEFENSE, if your controlled man falls too far 
behind the man with the ball, let him drop back all the way off screen. He 
will reappear in front of the man with the ball.

*	Remember that the BEST DEFENSE IS A GOOD OFFENSE. Get 
possession of the ball and keep it until you score!

IMPORTANT: BE SURE TO TURN YOUR GAME UNIT OFF WHEN 
NOT IN USE.
