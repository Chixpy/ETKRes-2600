DUCKS BITE THE BULLETS

What out! Ducks that you don't hit can fly down from the
bottom row to eat ten of your bullets!

Special Strategy: Make sure you use up at least eight bullets
before hitting the Extra-Bullet target.  Your bullet supply can
never show more than 40 bullets.

PIPE DREAMS

Eight on-target hits clear the pipes from the screen.  Hit the
same color pipes with the two consecutive shots and you get four
time the pipe score value.

Special Strategy: Knock out the pipes early in the game, while
avoiding the moving targets.  If the pipes remain in view while
you are hitting moving targets, ducks, ducks and more
ducks start coming out!

WIN SOME - LOSE SOME

Score extra points or bullets by hitting the plus-minus target
when the plus sign shows.  But look out!  If the minus-sign is
showing when the target is hit, the points or bullets are sub-
tracted from your score or bullet supply.

THE END

Clear the rack of all moving targets and pipes to move on to
the next higher level of game play.  The game ends when the
last bullet is fired.

To replay the type of game you have playing, press the
Game Reset switch.

                              SCORING

        Points scored for each target are listing according to
        level of play:

     TARGET           LEVEL:   1         2         3        4

     Pipe                     200       200       200      200
     Bottom Row                20        30        40       50

     Extra Bullet               8         8         8        8

Hit two pipes of the same color with two consecutive shots for
a score of 200 points for the first pipe and 800 points for the
second.

After you clear the gallery, 50 points are added to your score
for each bullet remaining at the bottom of the screen.  The
maximum number of bullets you can have in the Bullet Supply
is 40.
