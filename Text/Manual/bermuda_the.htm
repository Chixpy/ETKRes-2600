THE BERMUDA<br>
<br>
Game Description<br>
-------------------------<br>
An enemy has secretly occupied the Bermuda Islands protected by his fuel<br>
tanks, battleships, propellers, missiles and space arsenals. You are a com-<br>
mandant to command an exquisite battlewagon with unlimited bombs. Your<br>
mission is to stop all enemy dangerous attacks by launching bombs. You have<br>
three perfect battlewagons. Just when one is unfortunately destroyed by the<br>
enemy, another is going out to execute the order in place of the previous<br>
one. In the procession, there are a few icebergs to obstruct your battle-<br>
wagon.<br>

&quot;BATTLE-<br>
WAGON&quot; BOTH LOOK &amp; SOUND LIKE PROP DRIVEN AIRCRAFT. THE &quot;ARSENAL&quot; LOOKS
LIKE <br>
A LARGE &quot;+&quot;. YOUR SCORE IS BOTTOM-RIGHT, AND FUEL LEVEL IS AT BOTTOM-CENTRE]<br>

[There are no river-banks, instead, you use the full width of the screen.<br>
Icebergs replace houses on the shore. All enemy craft move right across the<br>
screen leaving one side and re-entering the other. Bridges are replaced by <br>
enemy arsenals. Looks quite different to River Raid &amp; plays differently<br>
too. Still good fun!]<br>
