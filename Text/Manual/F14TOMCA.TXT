Designer of TOMCAT
THE F-14 FIGHTER SIMULATOR(tm)
 
[picture of Kitchen in borrowed furry-collar flight jacket]
 
  I've always been fascinated by the technology of military fighter aircraft
and admired the courage of the pilots who routinely defy the odds in the
skies above. I've tried to incorporate the spirit and challenges of actual
fighter jet combat into this game and I've consulted with many actual
fighter pilots to ensure the accuracy of TOMCAT THE F-14 FIGHTER SIMULATOR(tm).
 
  I owe many thanks to my brother and co-designer Steven Kitchen, without
whose help we would not have made it off the flight deck.
 
  Here's thumbs up in your quest for Top Gun!

Flight Manual for TOMCAT: THE F-14 FIGHTER SIMULATOR(tm)
 
TO BEGIN:
 
1) With power OFF, insert your TOMCAT F-14 FIGHTER SIMULATOR(tm)
cartridge into your Atari 2600(tm) game system according to manufacturer's
instructions.
 
2) Plug joystick into left controller port.
 
3) Turn power ON.
 
4) Press RESET to begin game. At this point the cockpit controls of the F-14
TOMCAT will light up and you will see the deck of the aircraft carrier U.S.S.
Enterprise through your cockpit canopy.
 
  Your TOMCAT F-14 FIGHTER SIMULATOR(tm) features an intelligent RESET
function to guard against resetting the game by mistake. If you're in the
middle of a game and you hit RESET, you must hold it down for at least 2
seconds before a new game will start.
 
 
READY FOR FLIGHT:
 
  You're at the controls of your F-14 TOMCAT(not tm) fighter at 1900 hours,
waiting to receive authorization for take off from the U.S.S. Enterprise.
During your mission you'll face the enemy's most challenging air combat
forces. At your disposal are the state-of-the-art computer controls and
weapons systems of one of the U.S. Navy's most sophisticated fighters: the
F-14 TOMCAT.
  Your first take-off will be during daylight hours. But by the time you
receive orders to return to the U.S.S. Enterprise, you'll notice the approach
of dusk and you'll have to successfully perform a most dangerous nighttime
landing on the aircraft carrier. Your next mission will be a night mission.
You'll have to take off, engage in combat and return to the Enterprise in total
darkness, relying more on your computer control systems to see you through
safely.
  After each successful return to the aircraft carrier, or if you crash or are
shot down, you'll receive a MISSION RATING score (from 0 to 9) that is based on
your flying skills, the number of weapons fired, and kills. There are four
phases of flight operation: LAUNCH, FLYING, COMBAT, and LANDING.

Left -               Banks aircraft to the left.
 
Joystick Button:
Fires weapons when THREAT screen is up.
Chooses options when in select mode.
 
 
LAUNCH:
 
  You're on the flight deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise, waiting for your F-14
TOMCAT to be fueled and readied for take-off. After your fuel reaches its total
capacity of 3080 gallons and the angle of your wings opens to 20 degrees, the
FLIGHT DECK OFFICER (in the yellow jacket) will come out to signal you to move
onto the carrier catapult. Press and hold down the joystick button and push the
joystick forward to increase engine thrust. When you're locked on to the
catapult, the F.D. OFFICER will wave his hand in a circular motion to indicate
that it's time to throttle up. Press and hold down the button and push the
joystick forward until the ENG% indicator on your MAIN COMPUTER DISPLAY shows
that your engine has reached its full afterburner thrust of 216%. The F.D.
OFFICER will salute you, indicating that you are "go for launch" after which
you'll be automatically catapulted from the flight deck. After you clear the
flight deck, you'll hear the crash warning klaxon horn. Pull back on the
joystick to raise you nose (Angle Of Attack) and increase your altitude. You
will hear this warning sound whenever you are flying below an altitude of 500
feet with the aircraft in a diving position. On launch remember to flip the
LEFT DIFFICULTY SWITCH on your console to raise your landing gear.
 
 
FLIGHT:
 
  Once you're airborne, your MAIN COMPUTER DISPLAY will automatically switch
from the LAUNCH screen to the STATS 1 screen, which will show your SPEED
(measured in mach), your ALTitude (measured in feet from sea level: 0' -
999' when below 1000' or 1K' - 56.0K' when above 1000'), your nose Angle Of
Attack (from -50 degrees to +55 degrees), and your ENGine % of thrust (from
0% to 100%, 200% to 216% for afterburners).
  Pressing the SELECT button on your console will switch your MAIN COMPUTER
DISPLAY to show various information screens describing the condition of your
aircraft. For example, STATS 2 shows your WING angle (from +20 degrees to
+68 degrees), your ALTitude, your compass heading (C-HDG, 0 degrees to 358
degrees), and the amount of FUEL remaining.
  To increase of decrease your engine thrust, you must press and hold the
joystick button and move the joystick. Pushing the joystick forward increases
thrust, pulling it backward decreases engine thrust. When you are controlling
engine thrust, the STATS 1 screen appears automatically. The only time in which
you are unable to change thrust is when the THREAT screen is visible on the
computer display.
  To maneuver the aircraft, simply move the joystick forward, back, left or
right. Pulling the joystick back will raise your nose Angle Of Attack, making
the aircraft climb. Pushing forward on the joystick will reduce the nose Angle
Of Attack, making it dive. Moving it left or right will bank the aircraft. At
the altitude of 5000 feet you will hear a signal indicating that operating
altitude has been reached. The enemy aircraft will not engage before you have
reached this altitude. When your aircraft crosses the sound barrier (1.0 Mach)
you will hear a distant sonic boom.
 
 
COMBAT:
 
  For air combat, your F-14 TOMCAT is supplied with a sophisticated
computerized defense system, machine guns, and three types of air-to-air
missiles.
 
 
OFFENSIVE WEAPONS AND MANEUVERS:
 
  When an enemy aircraft, or BOGEY, enters your air          [small picture
space, the THREAT screen will automatically appear on         of bogey blip
your MAIN COMPUTER DISPLAY. The DETAILED DATA DISPLAY         on DDD]
(DDD) screen will also appear on the HORIZONTAL SITUATION
DISPLAY to show the exact location of the enemy aircraft. The BOGEY will appear
as a flashing blip on this top view display.
  The THREAT screen shows the condition both your offensive and defensive
weapons systems. You can bring the THREAT screen up at any time while you're
in flight by pressing the SELECT button on your console until the THREAT
screen appears.
 
On your THREAT screen:
  RNG shows the distance of the enemy from your F-14, measured in feet.
  or KILLS will show the number of enemy aircraft shot down.
  AIM indicates the type of missile you have ready.
  EC-M shows whether your counter measures are operating.
  M-61 indicates the on/off condition of your machine gun.
 
  Each time a new BOGEY enters your air space the klaxon horn sounds, the
THREAT screen appears and the BOGEY ALERT INDICATOR will flash. The HEADS
UP DISPLAY (HUD) will also appear on your visual screen. Through the threat
screen you can arm your F-14 with missiles or machine guns and fire them only
when the THREAT screen is up.
  To choose a weapon, simply press the RESET button on your console to enter
the select mode (be careful not to hold the RESET button for more than 2
seconds, since this will reset the game). On launch your F-14 is ready and
armed with an AIM 54 missile.
  You can choose between selecting a missile type, turning on/off your
Electronic Counter Measures (EC-M), and turning on/off your M-61 machine guns.
Moving the joystick up or down will highlight AIM-, EC-M, or M-61. Pressing
the joystick button will select one of these options.
  Pressing the joystick button while EC-M is highlighted will turn on/off your
counter measures and bring you back to the flying mode.
  When the enemy is at close range you should select your M-61 machine gun.
You start with 675 available rounds. The CANNON OVERHEAT INDICATOR will light
green, indicating that your guns are operational. When firing your guns,
the CANNON OVERHEAT INDICATOR will flash red to warn you that your guns are
in danger of overheating. When it turns bright red, your guns are overheated
and will automatically be shut down for cooling. When the lamp returns to
green, you can fire your guns again.
  Pressing the joystick button while AIM- is highlighted allows you to select
a missile type. The ARMAMENTS screen will now appear.
 
You have a choice of three types of Air Interception Missiles:
   AIM 7: Sparrow, infrared missiles (most effect when the BOGEY is visible
   on your viewing screen).
   AIM 9: Sidewinders, heat-seeking missiles (most effective when you are on
   your opponent's tail).
   AIM 54: long range missiles (the best choice for a novice pilot).
 
  You have 15 missiles available of each type. Move the joystick to highlight
the missile type you want and press the joystick button to arm your aircraft.
At this point you'll return to the flying mode. By pressing the joystick
button, you fire missiles or machine guns. When the BOGEY is within machine gun
range (approx. 500 feet) the HUD will flash red. You must continually fire the
guns for about three seconds to destroy the enemy aircraft.
  Each time you fire a missile you must wait until the MISSILE READY INDICATOR
lights to fire another missile.
  If you run out of a missile type, the computer will automatically select the
most effective missile type from your remaining armaments. You may also select
another type of missile by bringing up the THREAT screen and pressing the RESET
button.
  When using missiles, use the HEADS UP DISPLAY to lock your missile onto your
target by moving the BOGEY into the center of the HUD. The HUD flashes red when
your computer has locked on to the target. Firing at this time guarantees a
hit.
  If you run out of machine gun ammunition, the computer will automatically not
allow you to turn on your machine guns and arms any remaining missiles. If you
use all of your missiles, the computer will not allow you to select a missile
type.
 
 
DEFENSIVE WEAPONS AND MANEUVERS:
 
  When the BOGEY is on your tail and fires a missile at       [small picture
you, the CAUTION WARNING INDICATOR (see cockpit diagram)       of EC-M display
will flash. As the enemy missile approaches the C/W            with missile
INDICATOR will flash faster. If your electronic counter        blip]
measures (EC-M) are on, the EC-M screen will automatically
appear on your Horizontal Situation Display. The on-coming missile will appear
as a flashing blip approaching your aircraft.
  In order to avoid the missile you will want to take evasive action by
banking, climbing or diving. When the C/W INDICATOR has stopped flashing you
have successfully avoided the missile.
 
 
LANDING:
 
  When you are running low on fuel or have used up          [small picture
most of your available armaments, you'll be called           of landing display
back to the aircraft carrier. The LANDING screen will        with F-14 blip at
appear on your MAIN COMPUTER DISPLAY showing your SPEED,     top and horizontal
ALTitude, range (RND, your distance from the carrier),       landing blip at
and your Angle Of Attack, along with an audible return       bottom]
signal.
  Press the select button until STATS 2 screen appears on your main
computer disply. To land you must bring your compass heading (C-HDG) to
approximately 30 degrees (30 degrees to 40 degrees) by banking to the right
or left and lower the altitude of your F-14 to below 2,000 feet. Also, lower
your engine thrust to 30% in order to reduce aircraft speed for landing.
  After your F-14 has dropped below 2,000 feet at a compass heading of
approximately 30 degrees you will enter the landing corridor and, in a few
seconds, you'll see the carrier appear as a dot in the distance. The
COMPUTER LANDING DISPLAY (CLD) screen will appear on your HORIZONTAL SITUATION
DISPLAY.
  The CLD has two graphs showing your position relative to the aircraft
carrier. The top graph displays your altitude and range. Maintain the blip
between the upper and lower limits of your vertical glide path by adjusting
your altitude. Try to keep the aircraft's altitude between 60 and 80 feet. The
graph below allows you to center your aircraft horizontally. As you approach
the carrier you may encounter cross winds. Simply bank the aircraft to the
right or left to center yourself for a successful landing on the flight deck.
You must keep the blip in the center of the graph to ensure a safe landing.
When your aircraft is over the flight deck you will hear a warning sound.
Push the joystick forward to drop the aircraft onto the deck.
  When approaching the carrier and your landing gear or arresting hook is
not in the correct "down" position, a klaxon horn will sound. Flip the LEFT
DIFFICULTY switch on your console to lower your Landing Gear and flip the
RIGHT DIFFICULTY switch to lower the Arresting Hook so the aircraft can catch
the carrier cable.
  If you have landed successfully, you'll be back on the deck of the aircraft
carrier. Reduce your thrust to 0%. The RATING SCREEN will appear on your MAIN
COMPUTER DISPLAY, showing the number of KILLS, missiles FIRED, and providing
an overall RANK for your mission. Press the joystick button and you'll be on
the deck ready for another take-off.
  If you forget to put your landing gear or your arresting hook down, come in
too low, too high, or too far right or left on the carrier deck, you will
crash and receive a final rating. Hit RESET to start a new game.
 
 
FLYING AT NIGHT:
 
  When flying at night, you must depend more on your instrumentation,
especially when engaged in combat.
 
 
RATINGS:
0 - CIVILIAN
1 - SWABO
2 - RECRUIT
3 - SEAMAN
4 - LIEUTENANT J.G.
5 - LIEUTENANT
6 - LIEUTENANT COMMANDER
7 - COMMANDER
8 - CAPTAIN
9 - TOP GUN GRADUATE
 
 
TIPS FROM THE DESIGNER:
 
  It is a good idea to turn on your Electronic Counter Measures as soon as
you're launched from the flight deck.
  To avoid an enemy missile, adopt an eccentric flight path. Dive, climb and
bank quickly. If you haven't turned on your Electronic Counter Measures before
an enemy attack, you still have time to do so once a missile has been fired at
you.
  During combat, try to keep the BOGEY on your viewing screen at all times and
stay on his tail. This will keep him from getting behind you.
  While approaching the aircraft carrier for a landing, you'll see the carrier
landing lights before you. Keep the center line of lights straight to ensure
that you're centered on the flight deck.
  Approach the carrier at a speed well below 1.0 Mach to insure a safe
landing.
  To reduce the amount of fuel used during flight, throttle back your engine
thrust to below 100%.
  The altitude of the flight deck is approximately 60 feet.
