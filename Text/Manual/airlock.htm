Operations Manual<br>

[picture of a man running through a submarine corridor]<br>
<br>
You're trapped! Your disabled nuclear submarine, resting periously on an<br>
undersea ledge, has begun taking on water. With time running out for you and<br>
your crew -- and with your on-board torpedos shaken loose by an eerie current<br>
from deep under the sea floor -- it's up to you alone whether you sink or<br>
swim!<br>
<br>
<br>
A Data Age (tm) Video Game<br>
<br>
Survival Basics<br>
<br>
The objective of AIRLOCK (tm) is to retrieve the hatch keys<br>
and make your way to the next level before your compartment<br>
floods. But at the same time you must avoid the torpedos <br>
that have been shaken loose and which, when they cross your<br>
path, rob you of precious time.<br>
<br>
How To Handle Underwater Emergencies<br>
<br>
1. Hook up your video game system according to the manufacturer's <br>
instructions.<br>
<br>
2. With game console power OFF, firmly plug in your AIRLOCK (tm) cartridge.<br>
<br>
3. Turn game console power ON. You should see your sub on the screen. If no <br>
picture appears, check to make sure your game unit is hooked up correctly <br>
to your TV, then try steps 1-3 again.<br>
<br>
4. For the best contrast, turn the &quot;Brightness&quot; control switch on your TV to <br>
a low setting.<br>
<br>
5. Plug your joystick controllers into the left receptacle of your game <br>
console. For two players, use both joystick controllers (Player 1 uses the <br>
left controller and Player 2 the right controller).<br>
<br>
6. To ready the game for play, depress your &quot;Game Reset&quot; switch. You should<br>
see the game play graphics and your timer clock on the screen (49 seconds<br>
for Games 1 &amp; 2, 99 seconds for Games 3 &amp; 4). The &quot;Game Reset&quot; button
may<br>
also be used to restart the game at any time.<br>
<br>
7. Now select the game variation you wish to play by depressing the &quot;Game <br>
Select&quot; switch on your game console. The game number will appear in the<br>
Time Clock section of your screen. There are four variations of AIRLOCK:<br>
<br>
* Game No. 1 -- Single Player, 5 Airlock Levels.<br>
* Game No. 2 -- Two Players, 5 Airlock Levels.<br>
* Game No. 3 -- Single Player, 10 Airlock Levels.<br>
* Game No. 4 -- Two Players, 10 Airlock Levels.<br>
<br>
8. Select the game difficulty level by moving your console's &quot;Difficulty&quot;<br>
switch to position A (for beginners) or position B (for experts).<br>
<br>
9. To start game play, press the red Fire Button on your joystick controller.<br>
The countdown begins!<br>
<br>
<br>
Scoring<br>
<br>
Instead of racking up points on this one, you will be trying to beat the <br>
clock. You have 10 seconds to retrieve the keys to each level, make it into<br>
the elevator, and rise to the next level. Sound easy? Try it!<br>
<br>
<br>

&quot;HATCH KEYS&quot;;<br>
HANGING FROM CEILING, A &quot;RUNAWAY TORPEDO&quot; AND THE &quot;PLAYER&quot; BOTH MOVING<br>
ALONG ONE OF THE PLATFORMS.]<br>
<br>
<br>
When the red Fire Button on your joystick controller is pressed, the player<br>
will jump up and the timer will start. You must now retrieve the hatch keys<br>
in the proper order (orange first, white key second) and make your way to<br>
the elevator. Note that on each level the elevator (with an orange floor) is<br>
on a different side . . . the side closest to the second key you retrieve.<br>
To retrieve a key, move your player directly underneath the key, then press<br>
your Fire Button. The player will jump to collect the key. You will also use<br>
your Fire Button to move your player over the barriers on each level, as well<br>
as to help him jump over the torpedos that constantly move across his path.<br>
<br>
If you miss and are struck by a torpedo, it will not explode, but you'll be<br>
out of commission for several seconds before your player jumps up to resume<br>
game play.<br>
<br>
Once you have retrieved both keys on a level, the elevator doors will open,<br>
allowing you to enter the elevator. Be sure to go all the way to the end wall<br>
and have your player touch it. The elevator will rise to the next level.<br>
<br>
This process must be repeated for each level until your final escape.<br>
<br>
<br>
ADDITIONAL ESCAPE TECHNIQUES<br>
<br>
Here are some things that you need to remember:<br>
<br>
1. The torpedos cannot enter the elevator shaft, so once you have retrieved<br>
your keys and the door opens, move at once into the elevator and you'll<br>
be out of danger's reach.<br>
<br>
2. Try positioning your player so that he can jump a barrier and torpedo at<br>
the same time -- it can save you precious seconds, and the time you save<br>
at one level may help you out on the next.<br>
<br>
3. In games 3 &amp; 4, you have ten Airlock Levels to pass through. The first<br>
five levels, like those in games 1 &amp; 2, have two barriers per level. But<br>
the second five levels in games 3 &amp; 4 have four barriers per level. Not<br>
an easy task!<br>
